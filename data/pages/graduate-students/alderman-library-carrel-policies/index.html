<p>There are study carrels in Alderman and Fine Arts Libraries that are reservable to UVA graduate students.</p>

<p><strong>To apply for an Alderman study carrel or shelf in Alderman Library, contact <a href="mailto:shunter@virginia.edu">Stephanie Hunter</a>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>To apply for a Fine Arts Library study carrel, visit the Fine Arts Library circulation desk.</strong> <a href="#fineArts">Jump to Fine Arts Carrel Policies.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>Note that there are also short-term use lockers in the <a href="http://www.library.virginia.edu/map/#!/map/alderman/3/graduate-reading-room">Graduate Reading Room</a>. The keys for the lockers are kept at the front desk of Alderman. The keys check out for 3 hours at a time.</p>

<h2>Alderman Study Carrel General Use Policies</h2>
<img alt="A desk surrounded by bookshelves." data-align="right" data-caption="Old Stacks study carrels in Alderman Library." data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="4b0d631b-9120-4e56-a19b-21f3923832d6" src="/sites/default/files/inline-images/old-stack-study-carrel-300x225.jpg" />
<ul>
	<li><strong>Graduate students in good standing</strong> are eligible to apply for Alderman carrels or shelves in the Graduate Reading Room.</li>
	<li>Carrels and GRR shelves are assigned for an academic year. Graduate students may only have one or the other.</li>
	<li>Some carrels have two people assigned to them, so they must&nbsp;be kept tidy.</li>
	<li>Food should <i>not </i>be stored in carrels or shelves. Food will be disposed of if found.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Problem Reporting</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Problems with the carrel or the GRR shelf (burned out light, broken drawer lock, the carrel needs cleaning, etc.)&nbsp;should be reported to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:shunter@virginia.edu">Stephanie Hunter</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Renewal</h3>
<img alt="Desks with small windows on either side." data-align="right" data-caption="New Stacks study carrels." data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="ec5c8dfd-c54f-4a19-84d8-a5b8503f9e25" src="/sites/default/files/inline-images/new-stacks-study-carrel-300x225.jpg" />
<ul>
	<li>Carrels and GRR shelves&nbsp;<strong>can be renewed each year</strong> as long as the owner is a graduate student in good standing.</li>
	<li>Owners will be contacted near the end of each academic year with a renewal reminder.</li>
	<li>If an owner is not using the carrel or shelf, allow it to be reassigned since there is usually a waiting list.</li>
	<li>Failure to renew carrel keys or GRR shelves&nbsp;may result in loss of carrel privileges and check-in of any Library materials left on the carrel.</li>
	<li>Notify the Circulation Desk of address changes to ensure receipt of all correspondence regarding Library matters, including carrel renewal deadlines.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Keys</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Carrel keys must be returned immediately at the conclusion of carrel assignment.</li>
	<li>There is a $10 charge for nonreturned or lost carrel keys.&nbsp; Bills will be referred to Student Financial Services.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Carrel Charging Books</h3>

<ul>
	<li>All books and periodicals kept in carrels or on GRR shelves&nbsp;<b>must be checked out to the owner.</b></li>
	<li>Carrel owners should inform Library staff that a book will be put in a carrel or GRR shelf at the time of checkout.</li>
	<li>Books that are carrel charged are not desensitized, and a carrel slip will be placed in each book.</li>
	<li>Books without carrel slips may be removed and reshelved by Library staff, so the carrel slips should be visible.</li>
	<li>Keeping uncharged material in carrels may lead to revocation of carrel privileges.</li>
	<li>Do not keep carrel slips. Return carrel slips when returning books.</li>
	<li>Carrel owners should stop by&nbsp;the Circulation Desk when taking a carrel book out of the Library so it can be desensitized and the circulation record checked.&nbsp;The carrel slip will be removed at this time.</li>
	<li>Books are left in carrels at the ownerâ€™s risk.&nbsp; The Library does not assume responsibility for personal materials or books left in carrels or the Graduate Reading Room.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fineArts">Fine Arts Library Study Carrel Policies</h2>

<p>The Fine Arts Library offers carrels to graduate students in Art History, Architectural History, Architectural Design, Planning, and Drama.</p>

<p>Assignments are made for one academic year, beginning <strong>August 15</strong>. Carrels are assigned in the order in which your application is received. Carrel holders last year have first preference.</p>

<p>Due to space limitations, more than one person may be assigned to each carrel.</p>

<h3>Carrel Policies</h3>

<ul>
	<li><strong>All books kept in carrels must be checked out to you and have carrel slips in them or they will be removed from the carrel. </strong></li>
	<li>Do not store more books in your carrel than it will reasonably hold without damaging the books.</li>
	<li>Items sustaining damage from abuse or overcrowding will be removed and your carrel privileges revoked.</li>
	<li>Folios, reference, and other non-circulating items may not be stored in carrels.</li>
	<li>Electrical outlets are available in carrels 1-26 (some lettered carrels are near pillars on which there are outlets and most lettered carrels can reach an outlet with an extension cord).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Shelving Policies</h3>

<p>There are a limited number of shelves to be assigned to graduate students for the books they wish to keep at the Fine Arts Library. They will be assigned as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>One shelf to one graduate student.</li>
	<li>The number of books on the shelf will neatly line up to fill the shelf. No stacking will be allowed; any books not fitting on the shelf should be taken home.</li>
	<li>Each book on the shelf must have a carrel slip and be checked out to the user of the shelf.</li>
	<li>The shelf must be maintained neatly and must not hold anything that might spill onto the shelves below.</li>
</ul>
