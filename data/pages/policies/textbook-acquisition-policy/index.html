    <p>It is the general policy of the University of Virginia Library not to purchase copies of textbooks.&nbsp; We define a textbook as a monograph specifically intended for work in a classroom environment and have adopted the following specific definition found in&nbsp; ODLIS —Online Dictionary for Library and Information Science by Joan M. Reitz , Libraries Unlimited (last updated November 19, 2007) : “An edition of a book specifically intended for use of students who are enrolled in a course of study or preparing for an examination on a subject or in an academic discipline…sometimes published in conjunction with a workbook, lab manual, and/or teacher’s manual.”&nbsp;&nbsp; This policy does not apply to supplemental reading materials, most of which would ordinarily be acquired for the collection as a matter of course.<br />
There are a number of reasons we do not purchase textbooks:</p>

<ul>
	<li>One copy will generally not suffice for an entire class and buying multiple copies for all classes that need them is prohibitively expensive.</li>
	<li>Textbooks are generally expensive and are constantly updated, so repetitive purchasing over time would be required once started.</li>
	<li>The library has traditionally been resourced to purchase material for research and to supplement that used in the classroom, not basic curriculum material.&nbsp; Purchase of textbooks would fall outside of the library’s traditional mission and beyond our current level of funding.</li>
	<li>Space considerations make it impractical to maintain growing collections of textbooks in library stacks.</li>
	<li>&nbsp;Exceptions to this policy will be considered on an individual basis by the appropriate subject liaison.&nbsp; Possible exceptions include:</li>
</ul>

<p>A faculty member may make a specific request and is willing to put the book on reserve for an entire class.<br />
Subject liaisons may determine that a textbook broadly supports the University of Virginia’s teaching/research interests.</p>
