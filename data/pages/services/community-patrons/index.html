    <h2>Using Library Spaces and Materials</h2>

<h3>Things to know about visiting our library spaces</h3>

<p><strong>Visitors are welcome to Library buildings for research and study during regular <a href="/hours/">operating hours</a>.</strong> Different libraries hold different kinds of collections, and all have places to read and study.</p>
