<p>The University Library provides a variety of scanning services for faculty who would like text, images, or audio-visual materials to be digitized for classroom or research use. For non-UVA affiliated researchers, there is a fee-based scanning service for the digitization of archival materials housed in the <a href="/libraries/#special-collections">Small Special Collections Library</a>.</p>

<h2 id="inst-use">Instructional Use (Faculty and Instructor Users Only)</h2>

<h3 id="collab-mats">Digitization of Materials for UVACollab</h3>

<p>Instructional Scanning Services (ISS) provides assistance to faculty members and instructors by scanning and electronically delivering course related materials for use as additional readings or other instructional uses.</p>

<p>NOTE: Materials must be designated for a specific semester, less than 100 pages per request, and meet Fair Use Guidelines (Title 17, US Code) unless copyright permission has been obtained.</p>

<h4>Request Process</h4>

<p>To place a request, <a href="/services/ils/iss/">logon to the Interlibrary Services Web Request System</a>. (First-time users, please visit our logon page to set up an account.) The "UVACollab" option is on the left-hand side of the screen.</p>

<p>You will receive an e-mail with a link to a PDF when your document is available for download.</p>

<h4>Deliver Course Materials to Our Office</h4>

<p>Personal copies to be scanned can be delivered to Instructional Scanning Services in Alderman Library, Room 107, or dropped off at any UVA library with the instruction that they be sent to ISS, PO Box 400109.</p>

<h3 id="speccol-mats">Digitization of Special Collections Materials</h3>

<p><a href="http://dcs.library.virginia.edu/">The Digital Production Group</a> will convert rare books, manuscripts, maps, and other materials housed in the <a href="/libraries/#special-collections">Small Special Collections Library</a> to digital formats to support research and instructional needs.</p>

<p>NOTE: The condition of the material is taken into account when a request is placed, and in some cases the fragility of the original will render it impossible to digitize.</p>

<h4>Request Process</h4>

<p>Requests can be made through our <a href="https://tracksys.lib.virginia.edu/request">request form</a>. Your request must identify your affiliation (i.e. whether you are employed by the University of Virginia or not) and the means with which you intend to use the materials we deliver to you. Please review our <a href="/policies/">Use of Materials Requirements and Policy Statements</a>.</p>

<p>Users are notified via email that the requested materials are ready to be downloaded via a link in the email.</p>

<h3 id="video-mats">Digitization of Video Clips</h3>

<p>The <a href="/libraries/#robertson-media-center">Robertson Media Center</a> will digitize video clips for faculty to use in teaching and research. Clips save time by isolating portions of videos to show in class, release faculty from the need to fast forward or watch previews, provide a consistent viewing experience, and allow collection of related material in one location. Clips will be made available&nbsp;via USB drive or DVD.</p>

<p>NOTE: Clips are made available for internal teaching, research, and educational uses only and not for external distribution. The service is not for entire videos but only for short scenes or collections of scenes. Video clip requests will typically require a week to process, longer if the video needs to be purchased first.</p>

<h4>Request Process</h4>

<p>To make a clip request, fill out&nbsp;the <a href="/services/video-clip-service">online form</a>. We will need:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The version of the video from which you want the clips (if we don’t own a copy of the version you are using, we will need to purchase it for the Library or use your personal copy).</li>
	<li>The start and end times for each clip requested.</li>
	<li>A brief description of the content being clipped, especially at the start and end points.</li>
</ul>

<p>Users are notified via e-mail when the clips have been digitized. If you have additional questions, feel free to contact <a href="mailto:clem-vid@virginia.edu">clem-vid@virginia.edu</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://guides.lib.virginia.edu/c.php?g=514918&amp;p=3520108">Other questions about digitizing video for instructional use</a> should be directed to the <a href="http://guides.lib.virginia.edu/videos">Media Collections Librarian</a>.</p>
