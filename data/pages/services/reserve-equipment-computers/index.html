    <h2>Audio and Video Equipment</h2>

<p>The <a href="/libraries/#robertson-media-center">Robertson Media Center</a> Desk, on the <strong>3rd floor of Clemons Library</strong>, circulates audio, video, and presentation equipment to support students, faculty, and staff through the creative life-cycle of media production.</p>

<h3>Equipment available to the University community</h3>

<p>The items on the following list are available to the entire University community for a <strong> one-day checkout</strong>, on a first-come, first-served basis:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Canon Vixia video cameras</li>

<p>Items are due back by <strong>midnight</strong> of the following day. <strong>Renewals</strong> must be requested in person at the RMC Desk. Overdue fees accrue at <strong>$25 per day</strong>, due to the high demand for equipment.</p>

<h3>Equipment available for class project use</h3>

<p>The RMC Desk also circulates professional filmmaking gear, known as the high-end equipment, for class project use only. This restriction is due to the limited supply of equipment, and the growing number of class assignments requiring media production.</p>

<p>The following equipment can be reserved for <strong>course-related use</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Canon XF300 cameras</li>
	<li>Canon C100 cameras</li>
	<li>Light kits</li>
</ul>

<h3>Training</h3>

<p>Initial training and consultation are <strong>required</strong> to gain access to the reservation system. Training is a <strong>two-step</strong> process.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Watch the following camera instruction YouTube playlists:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmoC3HVFtXYglEY2GuaLlO_fr12djgWPJ">Canon XF300 Required Training - Basic</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmoC3HVFtXYjgG2mXW_lKxB-ueeSR_J-p">Canon C100 Required Training - Basic</a></li>
</ul>

<p>For students who want to borrow light kits, there is also a required training video playlist to watch:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmoC3HVFtXYiw2F4C3i9w_ywAUOZbsFVu">Light Kits Required Training</a></li>

<ul>
	<li>Please sign up<a href="http://cal.lib.virginia.edu/calendar/RMC"> here</a> for the in-person test. This session is also an opportunity for you to ask questions and get advice on how best to complete your project.</li>
	<li>Once you are certified, you will be granted access to the high-end equipment <a href="https://webapp01.lib.virginia.edu/dml-equipment/reserve/index.php?action=reserve_equipment&amp;pid=-1">reservation system</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tripods, wireless and wired lavalier microphone kits, and boom mic kits are also available in the reservation system.</p>

<h3>Borrowing Policies for the high-end equipment</h3>
