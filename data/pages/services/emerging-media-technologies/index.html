<ul>
	<li><strong>Self-directed:</strong>&nbsp;digitized images are made available to faculty via FTP; faculty use a variety of tools of their own choosing to manage and display.</li>
	<li><strong>Mediated:</strong> digitized images are uploaded to the Shared Shelf system; library staff will help with advising and training. Shared Shelf is a campus-wide resource with a rich set of tools and interfaces for managing and displaying images.</li>
