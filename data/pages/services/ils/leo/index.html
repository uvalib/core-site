    <h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The LEO service provides service to UVA faculty members by delivering library material <strong>for personal research use</strong> to departmental offices. Delivered library material includes items retrieved from a UVA library, or via Interlibrary Loan.</p>

<p><strong><img alt="" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="e3e95a7b-3b10-497d-8ab1-d6e31f41b65a" height="20" src="/files/inline-images/info-glyph.png" width="20" />&nbsp; Service Alert:</strong> We are expanding! Construction of the Ivy Stacks addition, an expansion of our off-site storage facility, begins in summer 2017. That means that you may see delays for materials ordered from our Ivy Stacks location. We will do all we can to deliver your materials in a timely manner. Thank you for your patience!</p>

<p>We will update this site as more information about service changes resulting from construction becomes available. Thank you for your patience!</p>
