    <p><strong>What we do:</strong>&nbsp;Our department is made up&nbsp;of a collection of services that deal with obtaining materials from other institutions for UVA faculty, staff, and students, delivering library materials to libraries, departments, and distance and continuing education students.</p>

<p><strong><img alt="" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="e3e95a7b-3b10-497d-8ab1-d6e31f41b65a" height="20" src="/sites/default/files/inline-images/info-glyph.png" width="20" />&nbsp;Service Alert:</strong> We are expanding! Construction of the Ivy Stacks addition, an expansion of our off-site storage facility, begins&nbsp;in summer 2017. That means that you may see delays for materials&nbsp;ordered from our Ivy Stacks location. We will do all we can to deliver your materials in a timely manner. Thank you for your patience!</p>

<p>Our work includes:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="/services/ils/ill/">Interlibrary Loan</a>, which <strong>borrows items not owned by the&nbsp;Library</strong>&nbsp;and <a href="/services/ils/lending/">lends items from the Library's collection</a> to other institutions</li>
	<li><a href="/services/ils/leo/">Library Express On-Grounds (LEO)</a>, <strong>a service for faculty</strong> that delivers books, journals and DVDs to departments On-Grounds</li>
	<li><a href="/services/ils/iss/">Instructional Scanning (ISS)</a>, which <strong>digitizes course related materials</strong> for inclusion in UVACollab sites as additional readings</li>
	<li><a href="/services/ils/scps-distance-education-delivery/">School of Continuing and Professional Studies/Distance Education Delivery</a>, a service which mails Library materials to <strong>SCPS and Distance Education students</strong> who live outside the Charlottesville/Albemarle County area</li>
	<li><a href="/services/ils/lending/">The Lending Department</a>, which <strong>lends books from our collection to other institutions</strong></li>
</ul>
