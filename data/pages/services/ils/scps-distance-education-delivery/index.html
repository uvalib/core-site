    <h2>Overview</h2>

<p>SCPS and Distance Education students living <strong>outside</strong> the Charlottesville/Albemarle area can request that books from the U.Va. Library or from other libraries be sent to their homes by setting up an Interlibrary Services (ILS) account.</p>

<h2>Request Process</h2>

<p>To register for an Interlibrary Services account:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Visit the <a href="/services/ils/">ILS web page</a></li>
	<li>Click on the First Time Users link at the bottom of the ILS Request Sign In logon form</li>
	<li>On the New User Registration page choose&nbsp;'Distance Education Student/SCPS' as your status type</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If you live outside the Charlottesville /Albemarle County area</strong>, please read instructions at the bottom of the ILS registration form under <em>Users who live outside Charlottesville /Albemarle County area</em>. Also, please be sure to list a “secure” address, where packages of books may be left if you’re not home.</p>

<p><strong>If you live inside the Charlottesville /Albemarle County area</strong>, you will need an Interlibrary Services (ILS) account to request books from other libraries, or to request books listed in VIRGO with an Ivy Annex or Ivy Stacks locations. However, you are not eligible for our delivery service and will need to pick your books up from a U.Va. Library.</p>

<h2>Delivery Address</h2>

<p>Please ensure that your <strong>address in the ILS system is current and correct.&nbsp;Your ILS account is separate from your regular Library account, and your address must be updated manually.</strong> If items are sent to an old or incorrect address, you are still responsible for these items. <strong>If they are irretrievable, then you will be billed for them.</strong></p>

<h2>Delivery of Material</h2>

<p>Articles will be delivered via e-mail in PDF format.</p>

<p>Books will be delivered to you via US Mail.</p>

<h2>Return Process</h2>

<p>We will be <strong>including a return mailing label in each package</strong> of materials we mail to you. &nbsp;The label will be attached to the ILS paperwork enclosed. &nbsp;When you are ready to return the items, simply place the label on the package and return via the U.S. Postal Service. &nbsp;(Remember, you must return all materials in a secure box.) &nbsp;Plan to return your items 2-3 days before the due date to ensure they are returned on time.</p>

<p><em>*Please note that materials may <strong>not</strong> be returned to another institution for mailing.</em></p>
