    <p>An embargo is a period of time during which your thesis or dissertation is saved in Libra but not available for worldwide distribution.</p>

<p><xmlns:texthelpns rwthpgen="1">While under embargo, the metadata (title, abstract, etc.) for your work is available to the world, but the full text of your work is not.</xmlns:texthelpns><xmlns:texthelpns rwthpgen="1">&nbsp; The type of embargo you are allowed varies by school.</xmlns:texthelpns><xmlns:texthelpns rwthpgen="1"> Usually embargo periods can be set for 6 months, 1 year, 2 years or 5 years.</xmlns:texthelpns><xmlns:texthelpns rwthpgen="1"> See below for details.</xmlns:texthelpns></p>

<h3><strong>Considerations For Embargoes</strong></h3>

<p>There are several reasons why you would consider an embargo:</p>

<ul>
	<li>To protect your ability to publish your work</li>
	<li>To satisfy requirements for review of grant-sponsored research</li>
	<li>To protect data being utilized by a team of researchers of which you are a part</li>
	<li><xmlns:texthelpns rwthpgen="1">To protect your ability to apply for a patent based on your research.</xmlns:texthelpns><br />
	&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>The Library cannot provide advice regarding the need for or proper length of embargoes, however, we are committed to working with you to ensure that your need for an embargo is met.</p>

<p>If you are a graduate student depositing your thesis or dissertation, we strongly encourage you to discuss embargoes with your advisor prior to submitting to Libra.</p>

<p><strong>Note that the nature of an embargo may vary by school</strong><xmlns:texthelpns rwthpgen="1">:</xmlns:texthelpns></p>

<ul>
	<li><xmlns:texthelpns rwthpgen="1">If you are a </xmlns:texthelpns><strong>graduate student in the School of Arts &amp; Sciences, School of Architecture, School of Nursing or the Curry School of Education</strong><xmlns:texthelpns rwthpgen="1">, the contents of your work will be visible to members of the UVA</xmlns:texthelpns><xmlns:texthelpns rwthpgen="1"> community during the embargo period and worldwide after the embargo expires.</xmlns:texthelpns></li>
	<li><xmlns:texthelpns rwthpgen="1">If you are a </xmlns:texthelpns><strong>graduate student in the School of Engineering and Applied Science</strong><xmlns:texthelpns rwthpgen="1">, only the title and abstract of your work will be visible to all users during the embargo period.</xmlns:texthelpns><xmlns:texthelpns rwthpgen="1"> Upon expiration of the embargo, the contents of your work will be visible worldwide.</xmlns:texthelpns></li>
	<li><xmlns:texthelpns rwthpgen="1">If you are an </xmlns:texthelpns><strong>undergraduate student</strong><xmlns:texthelpns rwthpgen="1">, your work will be permanently visible only to members of the UVA</xmlns:texthelpns><xmlns:texthelpns rwthpgen="1"> community immediately upon submission.</xmlns:texthelpns><xmlns:texthelpns rwthpgen="1"> There are no further embargo options for undergraduates.</xmlns:texthelpns><br />
	&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>These parameters are indicated on the submission form when you deposit your work.</p>

<p><xmlns:texthelpns rwthpgen="1">Please contact us at </xmlns:texthelpns><a href="mailto:libra@virginia.edu">libra@virginia.edu</a><xmlns:texthelpns rwthpgen="1"> for questions about embargoes.</xmlns:texthelpns></p>
