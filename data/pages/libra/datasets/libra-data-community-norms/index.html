    <h2>CC0 Waiver for Datasets</h2>

<p>By default, all datasets added into Libra Data&nbsp;are granted the CC0 Public Domain Dedication. Libra Data&nbsp;uses the CC0 waiver by default for all datasets (4.0 and on) because of its name recognition in the scientific community, making it a familiar option for data (for which in general copyright does not apply), and is in use by repositories as well as scientific journals that require the deposit of open data. For more information on the CC0 waiver, please visit the Creative Commons website (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0">http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0</a>). Data depositors can opt-out of using the CC0 waiver for their datasets, if needed.</p>

<p><em>Libra Data&nbsp;asks that all users who download datasets from Libra Data's services follow the following Community Norms</em>.*</p>

<h2>Crediting any research used with data citations</h2>

<p>Any materials (books, articles, conference papers, theses, dissertations, reports, and other such publications) created that employ, reference, or otherwise utilize the data (in whole or in part) gathered from deposited datasets should credit the source with the applicable data citation generated by Libra Data (found on the dataset page). These citations include the data authors, data identifier, and other information in accordance with the Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles (<a href="http://force11.org/datacitation">http://force11.org/datacitation</a>) for all research data. To find out more, visit Harvard's Data Citation Best Practices guide (<a href="http://best-practices.dataverse.org/data-citation/">http://best-practices.dataverse.org/data-citation/</a>).</p>

<h2>Maintaining anonymity of human subjects</h2>

<p>Users of the Service should not abuse the available data that relate to human subjects and use the materials to:</p>

<ol>
	<li>obtain information that could directly or indirectly identify any research subjects, or obtain information to attempt to directly or indirectly identify any research subjects;</li>
	<li>produce and/or publish connections among datasets that could identify individuals or organizations; or</li>
	<li>obtain (additional) information about or (additional) means of contact for already-identified subjects.</li>
</ol>

<p>*&nbsp;Legal Disclaimer:&nbsp;these Community Norms are not a substitute for the CC0 or custom licenses applicable to each dataset. Please be advised that the Community Norms are not a binding contractual agreement, and that downloading datasets from Libra Data does not create a legal obligation to follow these policies.</p>

<h2>Third Party API Applications</h2>

<p>If you are interested in building an API application designed (exclusively or not) to allow and provide access to Libra Data&nbsp;and its materials and services, please keep in mind that such applications:</p>

<ol>
	<li>must ensure that all users of the application read and agree to both the Libra Data&nbsp;API Terms of Use (<a href="/libra/datasets/libra-data-api-terms-of-use/">http://www.library.virginia.edu/libra/datasets/libra-data-api-terms-of-use/</a>) and Libra's&nbsp;General Terms of Use (<a href="/libra/terms-of-use/">http://www.library.virginia.edu/libra/terms-of-use/</a>);</li>
	<li>must post both the Libra Data&nbsp;API Terms of Use and Libra's&nbsp;General Terms of Use in an adequately noticeable and conveniently-accessible place so that all users of the application and easily find and view it;</li>
	<li>acknowledge and agree that Libra Data&nbsp;is not otherwise affiliated with any third-party Dataverse API applications that provide access to Libra Data, and therefore will not be held responsible or liable (in whole or in part) for any suits or damages incurred by the third-party Dataverse API application owners, administrators, and affiliates; and</li>
	<li>must clearly publish its third-party non-affiliation status in relation to Libra Data&nbsp;in its application and disclaim any special relationship with Libra Data&nbsp;outside of the ones arising out of the obligations agreed upon from this Terms of Use and Libra's General Terms of Use agreements.</li>
