<p><xmlns:texthelpns rwthpgen="1">Any employee (faculty/staff) or student of the University may submit datasets to Libra Data.</xmlns:texthelpns><xmlns:texthelpns rwthpgen="1">&nbsp; Please consider that UVA claims ownership rights to intellectual property, including data, generated with significant University resources.</xmlns:texthelpns><xmlns:texthelpns rwthpgen="1"> Therefore a researcher may not be able to claim sole ownership of his/her data and may need to consult with the University before placing the dataset in Libra.</xmlns:texthelpns><xmlns:texthelpns rwthpgen="1">&nbsp; Please see the memo on </xmlns:texthelpns><a href="http://data.library.virginia.edu/data-management/plan/privacy/datarights/">Data Rights and Responsibilities Guidance </a><xmlns:texthelpns rwthpgen="1">for more information, or consult with the </xmlns:texthelpns><a href="https://www.virginia.edu/vpr/">Office of the Vice President for Research</a><xmlns:texthelpns rwthpgen="1"> for guidance as to whether you may make your data available through Libra.</xmlns:texthelpns></p>

<p><xmlns:texthelpns rwthpgen="1">Please consider whether other researchers or colleagues have rights to manage the release of this data, for example others involved with the grant, research activity, or laboratory, whether at UVA or at another institution.</xmlns:texthelpns><xmlns:texthelpns rwthpgen="1"> If the answer to this question is yes, you must obtain their permission to deposit the data in Libra.</xmlns:texthelpns></p>

<h3 id="license"><strong>Why do I need to agree to the deposit license, and what does it say?</strong></h3>

<p><xmlns:texthelpns rwthpgen="1">While individual facts and observations are not protected by copyright and are free for all to copy and reuse, datasets include not only observed facts but also expressive content that could qualify for copyright protection.</xmlns:texthelpns><xmlns:texthelpns rwthpgen="1"> Accordingly, UVA needs the author(s)’ permission to store, display, and distribute these aspects of the datasets, and members of the public need permission to download and reuse them.</xmlns:texthelpns><xmlns:texthelpns rwthpgen="1"> And, because some aspects of a dataset can raise concerns about privacy, confidentiality, and other important legal interests, we need you to represent that your data is free from these potential hazards.</xmlns:texthelpns></p>

<p>Specifically, the deposit license requires you to affirm that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>You have the legal right and authorization to make this data publicly available online worldwide through Libra.</li>
	<li>You have removed any confidential or sensitive information, including all information that personally identifies any individual or that contains any information that should not be made public under state or federal law, or UVA policy.</li>
	<li>You have fulfilled any right of review, confidentiality, or other obligations imposed under any sponsored research agreement.</li>
	<li>You have made a reasonable effort to ensure that the data contained in your submission is accurate.</li>
	<li>You have appropriately acknowledged other researchers whose work contributed to the data.</li>
</ul>

<p><xmlns:texthelpns rwthpgen="1">The Deposit License confirms that you wish to make the material available through Libra Data to the public, to allow certain educational, non-commercial, public uses of the material under a </xmlns:texthelpns><a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CC0">CC0 license</a><xmlns:texthelpns rwthpgen="1"> (by default) or your own custom license, and to allow for preservation by the University.</xmlns:texthelpns><xmlns:texthelpns rwthpgen="1"> It is a non-exclusive agreement, meaning you retain the rights to use your data however you like.</xmlns:texthelpns><xmlns:texthelpns rwthpgen="1"> However, if you use a CC0 license, you are surrendering the relatively thin rights you may have had to limit others’ use of copyrightable aspects of the dataset.</xmlns:texthelpns></p>

<h3 id="change"><strong>May I delete or change a dataset that I have added to Libra Data?</strong></h3>

<p><xmlns:texthelpns rwthpgen="1">Because the repository is meant for scholarly work that is as close as possible to its final or published form, items cannot be deleted once they are deposited in Libra.</xmlns:texthelpns><xmlns:texthelpns rwthpgen="1"> &nbsp;Scholars should only deposit in Libra Data the version to which they intend to provide permanent open access.</xmlns:texthelpns></p>

<p><xmlns:texthelpns rwthpgen="1">If the Library determines or is made aware that a dataset has been deposited which contains non-public sensitive data or information, it retains the option of removing public access to the data at its discretion.</xmlns:texthelpns><xmlns:texthelpns rwthpgen="1">&nbsp; If you, the depositor, become aware of a rights or privacy problem with your data deposit, we ask that you let us know immediately and the Library will take prompt appropriate action.</xmlns:texthelpns></p>

<h3 id="available"><strong>Are items in Libra Data guaranteed to remain available in perpetuity?</strong></h3>

<p><xmlns:texthelpns rwthpgen="1">The Library and ITS are committed to the durability and sustainability of scholarship deposited in Libra.</xmlns:texthelpns><xmlns:texthelpns rwthpgen="1">&nbsp; Libra Data uses standard data management practices, including security and backup procedures, to provide a reasonable assurance that files will remain retrievable over time.</xmlns:texthelpns><xmlns:texthelpns rwthpgen="1">&nbsp; In addition, UVA Library is a founder and&nbsp; participant in the </xmlns:texthelpns><a href="https://academicpreservationtrust.org/">Academic Preservation Trust</a><xmlns:texthelpns rwthpgen="1"> consortium, which aims to ensure preservation of digital library content including Libra Data files.</xmlns:texthelpns><xmlns:texthelpns rwthpgen="1">&nbsp; However since permanent access is not a guarantee with any technology, we urge scholars to keep personal copies of their files.</xmlns:texthelpns></p>

<p><xmlns:texthelpns rwthpgen="1">The university reserves the right to remove content that is deposited out of compliance with the standards terms set forth in the </xmlns:texthelpns><a href="/libra/datasets/public-dataset-license/">Data Deposit License</a><xmlns:texthelpns rwthpgen="1">, or content that is deemed inappropriate for public viewing.</xmlns:texthelpns></p>
