    <p><a href="https://dataverse.lib.virginia.edu/"><strong>LibraData</strong></a>&nbsp;is a place for UVA researchers to share data publicly, and is part of&nbsp;the Libra&nbsp;Scholarly Repository suite of services which&nbsp;includes&nbsp;works of UVA scholarship such as articles, books, theses, and&nbsp;<strong>data</strong>. The LibraData repository is UVa’s local instance of Dataverse, developed and used by Harvard University.</p>

<p>Why Deposit data in LibraData?</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Increased visibility and impact of your research data.&nbsp;</strong><br />
	Sharing your data publicly can increase your research impact and visibility, creating additional opportunities for collaboration and connection within and beyond your existing network. To assist in the sharing process, a persistent identifier (DOI) is created for each LibraData dataset.</li>
	<li><strong>Safe management of your data.</strong><br />
	Depositing your research data in LibraData not only makes your data discoverable and accessible to a wider audience, but also keeps your data safer.&nbsp;The UVA Library, and UVA’s Information Technology Services, are committed to the durability and sustainability of scholarship deposited in Libra.&nbsp;Libra uses standard data management practices, including security and backup procedures, to provide a reasonable assurance that files will remain retrievable over time. LibraData will be preserved in the&nbsp;<a href="http://aptrust.org/"><strong>Academic Preservation Trust</strong></a>, of which UVA Library is a founding member and partner.</li>
	<li><strong>Fulfillment of journal and grant mandates.</strong><br />
	More journals and public and private&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PYOhBh6bglh6BkQFlpvNLOwlpzvQyguWAG8AkQMtU0s/edit#gid=0"><strong>funding agencies</strong></a>&nbsp;are requiring that researchers deposit data created as part of the research process. Publishing your data within LibraData meets the requirements of these mandates.</li>
	<li><strong>Valuable research time saved.</strong><br />
	Using LibraData’s easy-to-use interface to deposit, describe, and share your data saves you time and allows you to focus on your research.</li>
</ul>

<p>We’re using the Dataverse software developed by Harvard, but it’s important to note some differences between LibraData and Harvard’s repository. First,&nbsp;<strong>LibraData is&nbsp;UVA’s local instance</strong>&nbsp;of Dataverse. All data resides on servers&nbsp;physically located on&nbsp;the UVA Grounds, which is an important requirement for many agencies. Also,&nbsp;<strong>LibraData is for&nbsp;<em>final, publishable</em>&nbsp;products of research.&nbsp;</strong>LibraData is a place for UVA researchers to publish final research data&nbsp;for sharing publicly. You can also deposit data into LibraData even if it’s already been made publicly available through another repository. LibraData integrates easily with the&nbsp;<a href="https://osf.io/institutions/uva/"><strong>Open Science Framework</strong></a>, which allows collaboration and then enables publishing of research products at the appropriate point in the research lifecycle, including to instances of Dataverse like LibraData.</p>
