    <h3><strong>Electronic Thesis/Dissertation (ETD) Submission Checklist</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Before you can submit your thesis or dissertation, you must receive an e-mail from Libra</strong> with the subject: "<em>Access to upload your approved thesis to LIBR</em>A". Use the instructions below to successfully <a href="https://libra2.lib.virginia.edu">submit your ETD</a> to Libra.</p>

<h3>Before You Submit</h3>

<p><strong>1. Review <a href="http://copyright.library.virginia.edu/copyright-resources/essentials/">Copyright Essentials for Graduate Students</a></strong></p>

<p>A clear understanding of&nbsp;a few key copyright concepts will be important as you draft and submit your thesis or dissertation, both in understanding how and when you can use copyrighted third-party content in your own work, and in understanding your rights and opportunities to share your work as the author of your thesis or dissertation.</p>

<p><strong>2. Know your school’s instructions</strong></p>

<p>Check with your school for information on the proper process, workflow, and timing for submitting your thesis or dissertation.</p>

<p>Your school will direct you on its process for submitting your work:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://seas.virginia.edu/advising/graduation_procedure_MS_PhD.php">SEAS Graduation Procedure (MS and PhD Candidates)</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://graduate.as.virginia.edu/thesis-submission-and-graduation">GSAS Thesis Submission (MA, MS, PhD)</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://curry.virginia.edu/uploads/resourceLibrary/Timeline_for_Graduating_Doctoral_Students.pdf">Curry School of Education Dissertation Timeline (PhD)</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.nursing.virginia.edu/media/Graduation%20Requirements%20for%20DNP%20Students.pdf">School of Nursing (DNP)</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://mbaportal.darden.virginia.edu/ca/phd/Shared%20Documents1/Dissertation%20Submission%20and%20Graduation.pdf">Darden School of Business PhD Program</a> (Darden student access only, authentication required.)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. Know your open license options</strong></p>

<p>Libra lets you choose an open license&nbsp;when you post your work, and&nbsp;will prominently display the CC license you choose as part of the record for your work.</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC-BY</a> (permitting free use with proper attribution)</li>
	<li>All rights reserved (no additional license for public reuse) - users who download your work from Libra must comply with ordinary copyright law and seek permission for uses that are not fair use or otherwise permitted by law</li>
</ul>

<p>This license helps readers find your work, and makes it more likely that it will be read and re-used.&nbsp;Review the Creative Commons section of&nbsp;<a href="http://copyright.library.virginia.edu/copyright-resources/essentials/#CC">Copyright Essentials for Graduate Students</a>&nbsp;for further information.</p>

<p><strong>4. Know your embargo options</strong></p>

<p>Embargoes allow you to delay the release of your full work. Review your <a href="/libra/authors-rights-embargoes/">embargo options</a> and talk to your advisor to decide if an embargo is appropriate.</p>

<p><strong>5. Prepare an abstract and keywords</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>An abstract is required for submission to Libra. It describes&nbsp;your work's main focus to researchers interested in your topic. Using the abstract already included in&nbsp;your thesis or dissertation is fine. If your thesis&nbsp;does not already have an abstract, use a word processing or text editing program to create and save at least a paragraph describing your thesis to potential readers. Copy and paste your abstract into the submission form.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Keywords are optional but encouraged. Select at least 2 to 3 keywords that best describe the content of your thesis or dissertation. Keywords can be taken from the abstract and/or title. Individual words and/or phrases may be used. Use keywords that will be easily recognized by others in your discipline.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>6. Proofread</strong></p>

<p><strong>You may not delete or change dissertations and theses once they are deposited in Libra</strong>.</p>

<h3>Submit Your Work</h3>

<p><strong>7. Upload to Libra</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://libra2.lib.virginia.edu/">Log in</a>&nbsp;to Libra&nbsp;with your UVA NetBadge credentials.</li>
	<li>
	<p>Check the title displayed for your active thesis or dissertation on your Dashboard. The title in Libra must match the title as approved by your committee or advisor. If it does not, please report the discrepancy to your departmental administrator to make the corrections in SIS. Return to this step&nbsp;when the title has been corrected and proceed with your deposit.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Click "Edit" to enter description information. Required fields are indicated.&nbsp;Report errors in pre-populated fields to your Graduate Office.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Select an open license in the "Rights" field.</li>
	<li>
	<p>Click the "Files" tab to add all of your thesis or dissertation files.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Upload at least one file&nbsp;containing the final, approved version of your thesis or dissertation.</li>
		<li>The approved version MUST be in PDF format (PDF/a preferred).</li>
		<li>Acceptable file types for supplemental files are: CSV, GIF, HTM, HTML, JPEG, JPG, MOV, MP3, MP4, PDF, PNG, TIF, TIFF, TXT, XML.</li>
		<li>MP4 videos should have these specifications: <strong>H.264 codec, with AAC audio, in a .mp4 container.</strong></li>
		<li>Consider uploading large supplemental files or data sets to <a href="http://dataverse.lib.virginia.edu">Libra Data</a> and linking them to your thesis or dissertation.</li>
		<li><a href="mailto:libra@virginia.edu">Contact Libra staff</a> if you have questions about acceptable formats or need assistance with video or data file deposits.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Give each uploaded file a descriptive label&nbsp;that will be viewable to Libra visitors, or accept the recommended label&nbsp;<strong>N</strong>_<strong>LastName_FirstName_Year_Degree.type&nbsp;</strong>(e.g. 1_Jefferson_Thomas_1871_MA.pdf).&nbsp; The descriptive label will be the default name of the file when saved and downloaded.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If desired, record your embargo choice by selecting the visibility.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Check the box to agree to the <a href="/libra/etd-license/">Libra Deposit License</a> for Student Theses and Dissertations or contact your Graduate Office if you do not agree.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Click "Save and Exit" at any point to save a draft of what you have added and return to Libra later to "Edit" and complete your submission.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Click "Save and Continue" to view your descriptive information.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If there is information that needs editing or added, click "Edit" to make further changes.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Click "Preview before Submission" to preview the public view of your work before finalizing your submission.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>You may not delete or change dissertations and theses once&nbsp;you have clicked "Submit Thesis" </strong>so click "Edit" if you need to make additional changes.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Click “Submit Thesis” to finalize your submission.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>After You Submit</h3>

<p><strong>8. &nbsp;Check Your Submission</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Note the persistent link (DOI) for your scholarship. Add it to your CV, and share it if you chose to make it immediately open. Always provide this exact link when sharing your work with colleagues, collaborators, and on social media for the most accurate metrics on views and downloads.</li>
	<li>24 hours after deposit, you may check that your scholarship was successfully added to the Library's collection by searching for your thesis or dissertation in VIRGO, the UVA online library catalog.</li>
	<li>24 hours after deposit, please verify that SIS has been updated to reflect that you have completed this requirement.</li>
	<li>You will also receive email confirmation of your deposit, including the persistent link (DOI) for your scholarship.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Congratulations on your achievement!</strong></p>
