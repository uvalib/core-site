      <h2>2021 Course Reserves</h2>
      <p>The Library expects instructors to use electronic course reserve resources for all 2021 semesters. This practice allows students to limit time spent in library spaces, and it curbs the contactual turnover of physical materials. Electronic course reserves also position faculty for a potential pivot to exclusively online instruction at any point in the semester.
</p>
      <p>Instructors can request electronic versions of books and materials through <a href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/services/course-reserves/">course reserves requests</a>, including the scanning of journal articles or book chapters, and <a href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/services/purchase-requests/">purchase recommendations</a> or consult with research and instruction librarians in their <a href="https://guides.lib.virginia.edu/subjectlibrarians/">subject area</a> to consider alternative materials. For questions about the fair use of materials, see <a href="https://copyright.library.virginia.edu/classroom-scanning/">Copyright Guidelines for Instructional Sharing</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>Textbooks</h3>
<p>Please note that textbooks in electronic format are often not sold to libraries. Textbook publishers rely on profits from selling e-textbooks directly to students, and they don't want to jeopardize that market by offering online textbook access through libraries. Those that are available are usually very expensive. As courses increasingly move online, the Library will work with instructors to explore and identify viable e-textbook alternatives, including: non-textbook e-books already in  collections or obtainable by the Library; open educational resources (OER); and scanned chapters and excerpts of e-textbooks, subject to copyright limitations. The Library always endeavors to provide e-content that is free from digital rights management restrictions.
</p>
<h3>Assigned Books (Non-Textbook)</h3>
<p>Instructors should consult Library <a href="https://guides.lib.virginia.edu/subjectlibrarians/">subject area experts</a> about the availability of electronic copies of assigned books. There are many publishers of popular and academic books that do not allow institutions to purchase unlimited use of an electronic book. In other words, restrictions allow only one reader at a time for some e-books. Also, Kindle and Nook editions of e-books are not available to the Library for purchase.</p>

      <h2>Sustainable Scholarship</h2>
      <h3>Exploring the cost, value, and sustainability of big journal bundles </h3>
      <p>For years libraries have wrestled with the Big Deal value proposition: access to all of the journal articles controlled by a corporate vendor in exchange for one large, steadily-growing lump payment. An increasing number of libraries see
        that proposition breaking down. We believe this conversation needs to move beyond the walls of the Library, to include faculty, students, and other library users.</p>
