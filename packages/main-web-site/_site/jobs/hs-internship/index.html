<p>The University of Virginia Library high school student internship program provides high school students with the opportunity to explore the wide array of career opportunities in libraries. The internships aim to attract students from populations traditionally underrepresented in librarianship. To that end, minorities and males are encouraged to apply.</p>

<p>We catalog books and help patrons with reference questions, of course, but we also do 3-D printing, build websites and databases, digitize and preserve materials, maintain extensive archives of rare resources, teach classes in everything from research methods to GIS, support media creation, and much, much more…</p>

<p><strong>Please return <!-- <a href="/sites/default/files/2020-01/2020-internship-application.docx"></a> --> the completed application to your guidance counselor by March 1, 2020. </strong>Your guidance counselor should submit this application and one reference to <a href="mailto:libraryhsinternship@virginia.edu">libraryhsinternship@virginia.edu</a>.</p>
