<p><strong>What is it?</strong><a href="/sites/default/files/inline-images/Source-Deck-Sample.jpg"><img alt="Example of a Source Deck card" data-align="right" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="0941e9d8-050b-4e07-8288-333fde3e760d" src="/sites/default/files/inline-images/Source-Deck-Sample.jpg" width="300" /></a></p>

<p>The Source Deck is a set of two interlinked tools. The first is a physical deck of cards consisting of images of thematic information sources and their corresponding citations. The second is a slideshow presentation of the same information. All the sources, both academic and popular, current and historic, relate to a particular recent event that has been chosen to resonate with first-year students.</p>

<p><strong>How is it used?</strong></p>

<p>Beginning with a chosen learning outcome, we use the Source Deck to plan an activity that gives students time to demonstrate familiarity with the concept to be covered. These might include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Understanding the Publication Timeline</li>
	<li>Identifying parts of a citation</li>
	<li>Understanding source types</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Where can I get one?</strong></p>

<p>You can make your own! The Source Deck is meant to be created new every year, with a new theme and content customized by library instructors. You’ll find a sample Source Deck at this Google Slide link:&nbsp;<a href="http://goo.gl/LepUMV" rel="noopener" target="_blank">http://goo.gl/LepUMV</a>. We’ve included detailed instructions as well as tips for choosing a topic and collecting types of sources.</p>
