The American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC) publishes Guidelines for Selecting a Conservator and maintains a database of conservators in your area. Personal collections may have historic, financial, or sentimental value. Given the variety of material formats that may be in your personal collections (photographs, newspapers, letters, textiles, and video), you should seek information that addresses a format’s specific needs. The following resources provide up-to-date information on many material formats:</p>
