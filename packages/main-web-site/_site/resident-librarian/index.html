<h2>Examples of possible Resident Librarian positions</h2>

<p><strong>Resident Librarian for Special Collections&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The Resident&nbsp;works side by side with two staff in Special Collections: Molly Schwartzburg, Curator, and Krystal Appiah, Instruction Librarian. Tasks and projects are split approximately 50/50 between these two functions and&nbsp;will be developed around both in-house needs and the Resident’s own interests and subject strengths. Curatorial work may include collection development (selection of materials in all formats in targeted subject areas including gifts and purchases, relationship-building with dealers and donors, assistance with paperwork, materials workflow, and accessioning), outreach projects (content development for website, libguides, blog, and social media outlets), and exhibition curation (item selection, text composition, layout and design, and publicity). Instruction work may include teaching assignments (course preparation, preliminary meetings with faculty, and classroom instruction), outreach projects (designing and leading workshops for faculty and students, online and in-person publicity and outreach to the university community, and creating video tutorials), and assessment (researching assessment tools and evaluating the department’s instructional methods).</p>

<p><strong>Resident Librarian for Academic Preservation Trust (Consortial Repositories)</strong></p>

<p>Hosted and administered by the University of Virginia Library, the Academic Preservation Trust (APTrust.org) offers a range of experience to UVA-based DAI Residents.&nbsp; APTrust is on the forefront of digital preservation at scale for scholarly products and cultural heritage materials.&nbsp; A consortium of 16 research-intensive university libraries, APTrust is foremost a forum for discussion of the challenges of digital preservation in its twice-per-year face-to-face meetings and other on-line discussions.&nbsp; It operates an advanced digital preservation repository within the Amazon Web Services infrastructure, allowing for a close-up view of what it means for academic institutions to cooperate in using commercial cloud technologies to minimize the costs of such preservation.&nbsp; And it is actively expanding its services to new constituencies and at lower cost in coming months.</p>

<p>Most valuable to DAI Residents, APTrust is a case study of multi-institutional collaboration.&nbsp; Engagement with APTrust allows participants to observe and to help shape how such consortia are formed, how they can be sustained as effective entities over time, and how their relevance evolves, leading either to increased importance on its own or to the need to anticipate how its interests and services should migrate to other forums and organizations in the future.&nbsp; The key characteristic of APTrust that makes it most interesting is its radical transparency, especially with respect to its finances.&nbsp; Residents will be exposed to details about funding and about the personal and organizational qualities that give APTrust its unique personality, and they will what they need to participate in and lead multi-institutional consortial efforts.</p>

<p><strong>Resident Librarian for Data Services</strong></p>

<p>The residency in Research Data Services (RDS) is for the librarian who appreciates a traditional approach, but with a little data flavor added – one that includes research librarianship, data science, scholarship, and information literacy.</p>

<p>At Research Data Services, researchers across disciplines benefit from expert consultation and training in acquiring, collecting, wrangling, analyzing, visualizing, sharing, and preserving research data. Our data professionals, in collaboration with our research librarians, work to advance data science, using data to answer scientific questions, making analysis reproducible, and promoting open data to enable long-term discovery and knowledge.</p>

<p>The Social, Natural, &amp; Engineering Science team supports the research needs across scientific disciplines, from finding materials and managing information, to understanding the changing scholarly landscape and promoting information literacy. Information experts, together with our data team, work with students and faculty to enhance their scholarship and navigate resources across the University.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Residency in Information Services and Spaces (IS &amp; S)</strong></p>

<p>Information Services &amp; Spaces is, in some sense, the Library’s “public face.”&nbsp; It is in-person and virtual reference, circulation, and the public services desks in the Libraries.&nbsp; The resident will work directly with students, faculty, and researchers to answer all sorts of questions, such as:</p>

<p>“Where’s the bathroom?” “Do you have any information on the publishing standards of the US government?” “Which camera is best for my class movie project?”&nbsp; “How can I find the amount of oil used by all the airplanes in the world in 2016?”</p>

<p>A diversity resident in Information Services &amp; Spaces would participate as a full member of the reference and public service team.&nbsp; This would include answering virtual and in-person questions and learning about Springshare platforms used in our work – LibAnswers, LibCal, RefAnalytics, LibWizard, LibGuides.&nbsp; The resident would be expected to learn about the Library’s ILS, circulation activities, ILL, etc.&nbsp; The resident could expect to work in each of UVA’s libraries to better understand the similarities and differences among them.&nbsp; The resident could also expect to learn about the many collections available at UVA Libraries – government information, UVA specific resources, special collections, digital collections unique to UVA, etc.&nbsp; A resident in ISS might also expect to work with space issues in one or more libraries – rethinking user/public spaces, improving user comfort, evaluating public desk space, and the like.</p>

<p><strong>Residency in Digital Humanities (Scholars’ Lab)</strong></p>

<p>Digital Humanities approaches research, teaching, and learning in literature, history, the arts, and everything related to our past and present cultural heritage, with digital methods and publication forms.&nbsp; For example, creating and using computer software, websites, or mobile phone apps to teach learners or to help researchers (e.g. using virtual 3D spaces to recreate and make explorable lost urban spaces, such as the Soweto Township under apartheid regimes). Check out tinyurl.com/definedh.</p>

<p>The Scholars’ Lab for Digital Humanities at the University of Virginia Libraries creates a unique opportunity for a librarian curious about DH. We collaborate with faculty, librarians, and students on a range of projects and tools, including spatial humanities, data visualization, interface design, community building, games and virtual reality spaces, text analysis, digital archiving, 3D printing, and experimental humanities (including non-digital “maker” methods such as sewing).</p>

<p>The project for the Resident in the Scholars’ Lab would have the Resident working with the Head of Public Programs to design and run a DH workshop series aimed at UVA librarians. This “Praxis for Librarians” course builds on our successful Praxis Program’s mentorship of humanities grad students. Praxis mentors a cohort from those with little or no DH knowledge to publicly releasing their own team project by the end of the year. Similarly, we hope to support our library colleagues with an intensive opportunity to learn about DH in a collaborative, project-focused experience.</p>

<p>Running a Praxis for Librarians series is the starting goal.&nbsp; We would tailor our Resident’s experience to DH methods and communities that most keenly interest them, after exposing them to a variety of options during their first months with us.&nbsp; Core skills based on existing Praxis curriculum:&nbsp; Understand defining reasonable scope, long-term thinking, and information management for DH project; Create their own professional website; Blog and tweet; Practice leading faculty and student DH consultations; Collaboration and credit; Project management.</p>

<p><strong>Residency in Scholarly Communication&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The resident in Scholarly Communication will work in open publishing, open access, changes in subscription models, author rights, and preservation of the scholarly record.&nbsp; By open access we mean “literature that is digital, online, free of charge, and free of most copyright and licensing restrictions.” The Resident will closely work with faculty-authors, liaison (subject) librarians, and others active in this sphere. The resident will create and disseminate open access talking points that resonate with faculty and staff, draft recommendations on how the library can more effectively communicate its Scholarly Communications services and policies, and identify the necessary resources to better support and advocate for new models of open scholarship. The Resident will have deep knowledge of issues and approaches necessary to lead library scholarly communication efforts.</p>

<p><strong>Resident Librarian (</strong><strong>International Government Information)</strong></p>

<p>The University of Virginia Library is a depository for the United Nations and European Union.&nbsp; In addition, it holds large international governmental organizations (IGO) collections from UNESCO, the World Bank, OECD, the International Monetary Fund, and many others.&nbsp; It offers databases from OECD, the United Nations, the EU, the IMF, and the World Bank.</p>

<p>Use and knowledge of these collections and the research value in them is not as ubiquitous.&nbsp; Many researchers find the information on their own via the Internet, but others simply do not discover the excellent economic, development, financial, diplomatic, sociological, demographic, governmental, and historical primary source information available in IGO materials.</p>

<p>The resident who took on this assignment—anywhere from a year to three years—would be committing to learning about a myriad of government information resources, including those of the U.S. government.&nbsp; He or she would analyze our IGO collections—recommending withdrawals and additions as appropriate.&nbsp; He or she would look at workflow from acquisition to cataloging to shelf prep to shelf—recommending changes as appropriate and possible.&nbsp; She or he would work with the Collections Team to analyze our current acquisitions and make recommendations regarding what and how much and in what formats we acquire the materials.</p>

<p>A Diversity Resident would also have responsibilities as a reference librarian, specializing in IGO and U.S. government information.&nbsp; The resident would be expected to learn about the history of publication in various organizations and agencies, reference and statistical resources, databases, and generally learn about the agencies and IGOs to better assist our users in discovery of relevant research and data.</p>

<p>This residency is housed in the Information Services &amp; Spaces department. Information and Spaces is the public facing entity of eight reference librarians and paraprofessionals working with students, faculty, patrons, across all areas of the Library, and pan-University.</p>

<p><strong>Teaching &amp; Learning Residency</strong></p>

<p>A residency in Teaching &amp; Learning offers an opportunity for the Resident to dig deeply into the practice and theory of teaching, engage with students through classes and outreach, and collaborate on new initiatives to enhance the student learning experience. Whether a novice or veteran educator, this residency is ideal for the person who can be both dynamic in front of the classroom and creative in designing new programs and tools.</p>

<p>Teaching and Learning Residents will work within a team of educators, instructional technologists, and outreach experts and will explore the multiple facets of teaching in a research library. Day-to-day work and projects will be tailored to both the needs of the Library and the Resident’s own interests and strengths. Working closely with peers and the Director of Teaching and Learning, the Resident will have individualized support to gain the expertise and skills needed to match those interests.</p>

<p>Major areas of focus will be chosen after the Resident has had the opportunity to explore the full range of Teaching and Learning priorities and projects. Responsibilities will include teaching both individually and with other librarians; developing expertise in instructional pedagogy and design; and, consulting with faculty and subject liaisons on class preparation, active learning, and assessment. Other possibilities include teaching and programming in makerspaces; creating learning tutorials and videos; and, outreach strategies and programming. At the close of the residency, the Resident will have worked on a meaningful project that benefits not only the University of Virginia but positions the Resident to move into a future position as a Teaching and Learning Librarian with bountiful skills and expertise in the field.</p>

<p><strong>Preservation Residency</strong></p>

<p>The University of Virginia Library strives to maximize the life expectancy and utility of collections, regardless of format, for current and future scholars. The ultimate aim is to ensure access to materials that enable research, teaching, and learning.</p>

<p>Preservation is divided into four areas:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Book and Paper Conservation</li>
	<li>AV Conservation</li>
	<li>Digital Preservation</li>
	<li>Collections Care and General Administration</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on interest and skill level, the resident might take a deeper dive into a specialization that matched their interests and skills levels.&nbsp; For example, the Resident interested in description and access could work with the AV conservation unit captioning rare and unique materials in order to increase access and discoverability for all types of users.&nbsp; A Resident interested in born digital content might explore ingest processing and creating archival description and access workflows, or delve into the technical and ethical aspects of web archiving.&nbsp; If a Resident is interested in the decision-making process for the conservation of physical materials they create surveys that allow a collections manager, librarian or curator to partner with conservation professionals.&nbsp; A Resident interested in collections care will develop strategies for stabilizing materials for transport and storage to off-site storage or plan the environmental monitoring program for the renovated Alderman Library.&nbsp; Working knowledge of preservation concepts encouraged but not required.</p>

<p>Skills needed: attention to detail; Good working with one’s hands; Strategic thinking; Organizational skills; Project management skills; Writing and presentation skills; Creative problem solving</p>

<p>Tangible results of a Resident’s rotation in Preservation will be a completed project, (a workflow, a survey, or a project) about which they can write and present.&nbsp; Developing and refining excellent skills in collaboration across units, complex decision-making, and evaluating outcomes are equally important areas of growth for the resident.</p>

<p><strong>Resident Librarian for Library Information Technology (LIT)</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>LIT works collaboratively with the Library, the University and the higher education community to provide cost effective and accessible solutions for hardware, software (licensed and open source) and user experience.</p>

<p>The resident librarian would join 36 engineers, librarians, and students organized into four teams: User Experience (UX), Scholarly Access Technologies (SAT), Space and Infrastructure Technologies (SIT), and Digital Content Management &amp; Dissemination (DCMD).</p>

<p><strong>UX (User Experience)</strong>: This team leverages methods (focus groups, usability studies, feedback mechanisms) and assessments to define, shape, and prioritize Library physical and online services. It offers methods to support library projects, manages the public and staff content management systems and websites incorporating the University brand elements, website information architecture, designs, and develops accessible/inclusive user interaction (UI) for all online services and works closely with communication to offer internal staff newsletter, emergency messaging, library service information, and digital and physical signage.</p>

<p><strong>SAT (Scholarly Access Technologies)</strong>: provides Virgo (global search and discovery service for all Library content), master and subsidiary indexes, database administration, Virgo-GIS and services to ingest and manage Libra—the institutional self-deposit repository services &nbsp;such as open access, ETDs, and research data.</p>

<p><strong>SIT (Space and Infrastructure Technologies):&nbsp;</strong>a sub team that manages staff and space technologies, in addition to engineers managing license applications, development operations, compute, storage and the Library Service Platform.</p>

<p><strong>DCMD</strong>&nbsp;<strong>(Digital Content Management &amp; Dissemination):</strong>&nbsp;a software development and application team providing technologies supporting digitization and born digital workflows, canonical metadata description, AV streaming/description/dissemination, preservation tools, core and subsidiary repositories, IIIF image servers, and dissemination to discovery and preservation.</p>

<p>LIT is expanding to include a cloud architect and lead software engineer to assist in the design, support and migration to cloud services, research and strengthen cost effective development operations and work to mentor/lead staff development and practice.</p>

<p>Prospective Resident Librarians interested in this area should note LIT does not manage technologists working for Academic Preservation Trust, The Scholar’s Lab Digital Humanities efforts, nor those working in the Robertson Media Center or the Data Science areas.</p>
