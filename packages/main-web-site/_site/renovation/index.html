<p class="bigFirstLetter">The renovation of our main library marks the third chapter in the University’s history. The first chapter began when the Rotunda, UVA’s first Library, was constructed as the focus of Grounds—a notable departure from the customary practice of centering universities around religious buildings. The second chapter began with the opening in 1938 of a new building to replace the Rotunda as the main library, with a much larger and more current collection, and UVA began to function as a research university.</p>
<p>The renovation will bring the Library up to current standards of safety, accessibility, and service. But more importantly, it is essential to restore our main library to the position it enjoyed when it opened—a contemporary library with
    modern amenities suited to the needs of its users.</p>
