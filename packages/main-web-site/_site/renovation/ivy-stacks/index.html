<p>Ivy Stacks is a high-density storage and retrieval facility located one mile west of Alderman Library. It currently holds over one million books and other materials from the University of Virginia’s libraries, all of which are available for checkout <a href="http://search.lib.virginia.edu/catalog">through VIRGO.</a></p>

<p>A recent expansion of the facility took place, which doubled the amount of materials the facility can contain. Additionally, an on-site reading room was built for researchers. Ivy Stacks is outfitted with solar panels to reduce its energy footprint. </p>

<p>The video below from UVA Magazine demonstrates how requests are filled and how this facility differs from our other libraries.</p>

<h2>Ivy Stacks Expansion</h2>


<p>Ivy Stacks expansion took place in Fall 2017 and Spring 2018, and doubled the facility's capacity.</p>

<p>On December 14-15, 2017, the tilt-up walls to the new facility were installed. Check out photos from this event to see this fascinating process: <a href="https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPgPM5gdzyFqwx9xzEDZm5X5PQkX-KBN1r6HPgNwWxjOWld2aOuL31YWJDKcSV2mA?key=UGtHN25VZ3dfRVBCano1N2xFMEpHTmxmWkl0Rnl3">Album 1</a> <em>(photographer: Guy Mengel)</em>, <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/ecbbl9KW0uKxSqDU2">Album 2</a> <em>(photographer: Amber Lautigar Reichert)</em>, <a href="https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipMyC9brV4P8BrOosy-JUKvT7aMXq5NUICa5GNNlvUzYbdCoXIHiQBr9rHtmGNSf5g?key=d1ZSR2RBNVY4NjlVN2NmN1RFRzdGc3ItOEFSal9B">Album 3</a> <em>(photographer: Dave Griles)</em>.</p>
