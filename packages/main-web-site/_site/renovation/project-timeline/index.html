<p>On April 20, 2016, the Virginia legislature passed House Bill 1344, a capital projects funding bill that approved funding for a planning study to: “Renovate Alderman Library, Life Safety Phase I.” &nbsp;The focus is on fire, safety, and system renewals of the building, although there is also some acknowledgment that mission update and modernization is included.</p>

<p>Anticipated timeline and list of relevant documents can be found below.</p>

<h2>Timeline Details</h2>

<p><strong>Spring 2016:</strong> Renovation planning officially begins.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Summer 2017:</strong> Ivy Stacks expansion begins, effectively doubling the storage space at the Library's off-site shelving facility. <a href="/renovation/ivy-stacks/">This "enabling project" was completed in May 2018.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p><strong>Fall 2017: </strong>Inventory to obtain official collection numbers begins. As part of the inventory, library materials are cleaned and catalog records are verified, thus improving overall discoverability. <a href="https://news.library.virginia.edu/2018/08/29/massive-alderman-inventory-project-eases-discovery-of-library-collections/">Project completed in December, 2018.&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;HBRA Architects are selected to design the renovation of Alderman Library.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Summer 2018: </strong><a href="https://news.library.virginia.edu/2018/03/19/as-clemons-library-closes-for-the-summer-other-libraries-work-to-lessen-impact/">Clemons Library improvements:</a> HVAC systems were replaced and bathrooms renovated. Additionally, compact shelving installed&nbsp;on the first floor will improve access to substantial portions of the collection during Alderman renovation (an additional "enabling project"). The first floor of Clemons Library will re-open in Summer 2019.</p>

<p>In June 2018, concept plans for the renovation were presented to the UVA Board of Visitors.</p>

<p><strong>Fall 2018: </strong>With BOV approval, preliminary plans were developed and delivered to the Virginia General Assembly for approval in the 2019 session.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>May 2019:</strong> Collection moves begin, with high-use materials moving to Clemons Library and all other materials moving to Ivy Stacks, the off-site shelving facility located one mile from central Grounds. Move is completed by December 2019. <a href="/renovation/alderman-collections/move">View book move schedule.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>June 2019:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.usa.skanska.com/">Skanska</a>&nbsp;is awarded the construction management contract for the Alderman Renovation Project.&nbsp; HBRA&nbsp;and University staff start working with Skanska on construction documents and developing a construction project schedule. Information about the schedule will be shared as it becomes available.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>January 2020:</strong>&nbsp;The cleared stacks are the focus of pre-demolition work: asbestos abatement, rerouting utilities, and bracing the building.</p>

<p><strong>Summer 2020: </strong>The Library closes to the public after Spring semester 2020, and demolition will begin. Renovation and new construction will follow, with the expectation that work will require three summers and two academic years.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Spring&nbsp;2023: </strong>Alderman Library re-opens no later than Spring 2023!</p>
