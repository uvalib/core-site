<p>When planning began for the new Alderman Library the collection was about a quarter-million books, with growth capacity to accommodate 600,000 books. By the time the Library opened in 1938 the print collection was over three-hundred thousand books. A <a href="https://news.virginia.edu/content/alderman-doing-its-first-inventory-80-years-heres-whats-turned-so-far"> recent inventory </a>, the first since Alderman opened, revealed that the library now holds about 1.7 million volumes.</p>

<p>About 60% of Alderman&rsquo;s collection is in book format and uses the Library of Congress (LC) classification scheme, as indicated above. The remainder of the collection, approximately 40%, are US and Virginia government documents, newspapers, microforms, maps, and other materials. All the items in the collection were selected by librarians from state and local funds, given as gifts, requested by members of the UVA community, or provided to us as a U.S. depository library.</p>
<p>  The goal, since Alderman Library opened, has been to create an academic collection that meets the research and teaching needs of our faculty and students. Those needs change over time, and the collection reflects that evolution, over nearly a century. </p>

<h3><strong>The Collection During the Renovation</strong></h3>
<p>The Alderman Library collection needs to be removed from the building before renovation begins. The strategy for managing the collection during renovation, approximately five years, involves doubling the capacity at Ivy Stacks and installing compact shelving on the first floor of Clemons Library. </p>
<ul>
<li>Books that will be provided from Clemons will include high-use materials from every subject area of the Alderman and Clemons print book collection. This will provide a browsable collection of at least 500,000 items immediately retrievable from compact shelving by library users, with room for five years of growth in the print collections.  </li>
<li>The remainder of the materials from Alderman will move to Ivy Stacks, where print materials are shelved in preservation-quality environmental conditions.  During the renovation, these materials can be retrieved in the same way users now retrieve Ivy Stacks materials.  In order to increase efficiency in using this collection, any items retrieved from Ivy Stacks during renovation will be reshelved with the browsable collection in Clemons.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Collection in the Renovated Alderman Library </h3>
<p>We expect that a renovated Alderman Library will be beautiful and safe, and will meet the needs of all the Library&rsquo;s users.  It will house substantial print collections throughout the building, with the highest concentration of books in the areas of new construction.   When we have finalized floor plans and have determined, in conversation with library users, the tolerance for compact shelving and the criteria we will use to select the collections that return to Alderman from Ivy Stacks and from Clemons, we will be able to specify the number of items that will be in Alderman Library post-renovation.  We expect those collections will be more deliberately curated, easier to find and use, and better preserved than ever before.  </p>
