<p>A number of committees will help steer the renovation as it gets underway. These groups are still in developmentâ€”updated information will be posted here as it becomes available. If you have ideas, questions, or concerns for any of the committees or teams, please contact Brenda Loewen, Project Manager for the&nbsp;Alderman Renovation, at <a href="mailto:bsl3r@virginia.edu">bsl3r@virginia.edu</a>.</p>

<p>The <strong>Alderman Renovation Steering Committee</strong> provides general guidance for strategy, vision, and University-wide matters regarding the renovation, and committee members acts as needed as consultants/sounding board for the concerns of the Project Working Group.</p>

<p>The <strong>Alderman Renovation Project Working Group (PWG)</strong> is a subset of the steering committee and is charged with spear-heading leadership and decision-making within the Committee.</p>

<p>In addition, the Library has internal teams working on <strong>Communication</strong>, <strong>Collections</strong>, and <strong>Public Services</strong> as they pertain to the renovation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
