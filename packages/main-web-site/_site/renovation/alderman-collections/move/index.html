<p>Our goal is to complete the book move in November but flex time has been built in through December in case unforeseen challenges necessitate additional time. We anticipate the move being fully complete by end of calendar year 2019.</p>

<p>*Within any given call number range, the Clemons items will begin their move first, and Ivy Stacks items will begin their move shortly thereafter. </p>
