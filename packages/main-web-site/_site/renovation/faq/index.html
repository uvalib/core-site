<p>The main library will be closing for renovation beginning in May 2020. The 2019-20 academic year will be a transitional period where preparations will be made to minimize the duration of the closure. The space is expected to reopen by the spring of 2023.</p>

<h2>What's happening to the collections?&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Materials have been moved from&nbsp;Clemons and Ivy Stacks.&nbsp;During the renovation, high-use items will be available for browsing in Clemons, and the full collection will remain available on-demand from Ivy Stacks:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The first floor of Clemons now holds a large browsing collection of social sciences, humanities, and reference materials from the main library (about 500,000 volumes).
	<ul>
		<li>Most items recalled from Ivy during the renovation are likely to remain in Clemons for the duration of the renovation.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Items not moved to Clemons will be moved to Ivy Stacks.
	<ul>
		<li>Most main library&nbsp;items held at Ivy during the renovation will return to the main library when it reopens.</li>
		<li>Most Government Documents are likely to remain at Ivy.</li>
		<li>Items at Ivy will be delivered to Grounds upon patron request.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>No materials are being removed from circulation.</li>
	<li><strong>All items held by the UVA Library will remain discoverable in&nbsp;<a href="http://search.lib.virginia.edu">Virgo, the Library's catalog</a>.</strong>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="visitClemons3">Will we be able to browse the Clemons materials while the books are moving?</h2>

<p>Yes! The newly-renovated Clemons Stacks (1st floor) is now open for browsing and study.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="new-books2">Will the library still acquire new books during the renovation?&nbsp; Where will those books go?</h2>

<p>Yes, we will continue to acquire new books and they will be added to the collection on the first floor of Clemons Library.</p>

<h2>What do we know about the collections in renovated Alderman?</h2>

<p>Renovated Alderman Library will be beautiful and safe, and will house substantial print collections throughout the building, with the highest concentration of books in the areas of new construction. <a href="/renovation/project-planning-documents/collection">More Collections information pertaining to the Renovation. </a></p>

<h2 id="visitIvyStacks">Can I visit Ivy Stacks in person?&nbsp; Do I need an appointment to do it?</h2>

<p>Yes and yes. The Ivy Stacks Reading Room is available by appointment to view large sets of materials not feasible to be transported to a library location On-Grounds.</p>

<p>Appointments must be made&nbsp;<strong>5 business days in advance</strong>&nbsp;of a visit, and are available Monday-Friday between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. <a href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/policies/ivy-stacks">Learn more and make an appointment to visit.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p><strong>New! Shuttle to Ivy Stacks:&nbsp;</strong>Parking and Transportation is running a pilot program from March 2 to end of June, 2020.&nbsp;<a href="http://news.library.virginia.edu/2020/02/19/shuttle-to-ivy-stacks-available-march-to-june/">Learn more about the Ivy shuttle.&nbsp;</a></p>

<h2 id="documentingAlderman">What is the project's timeline?</h2>

<p>Governor Ralph Northam and the General Assembly approved the appropriation to move this capital project to the construction phase in April 2019. In June 2019, Skanska was awarded the construction management contract for the project. Skanska is now working with HBRA and UVA to develop a construction project schedule.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The main&nbsp;library will be closing for renovation in May 2020. The space is expected to reopen by the spring of 2023.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/renovation/project-timeline">Read more about the project's timeline.</a></p>

<h2 id="mitigation">What is the Library doing to mitigate the impact of the renovation?</h2>

<p>Prior to embarking on the Renovation, the Library doubled the capacity of <a href="/renovation/ivy-stacks">Ivy Stacks, our off-site shelving facility</a>, to allow for preservation-quality storage and quick retrieval of Library materials. Additionally, high-density shelving was added to the first floor of Clemons Library to house a significant browsing collection of high-demand items which would normally be found in the main library.</p>

<p>Additionally, we are currently working to expand scanning and LEO services to graduate students, and are collaborating across the University to identify pain points and alleviate frustration whenever possible.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="leo-grads">What's the timeline for LEO for graduate students to be implemented?</h2>

<p>Beginning Fall 2019, the library is pulling requested items from the stacks for grad students and delivering them to departments that have or have created a suitable space for their graduate students mail boxes, or to a library of the grad studentâ€™s choosing. <a href="https://news.library.virginia.edu/2019/08/29/leo-delivery-for-graduate-students-whats-new/">Read more about LEO for graduate students.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>Additionally, we are honoring requests for scans of articles and book chapters from materials that UVA owns.</p>

<h2>Will there be any changes to LEO/document delivery for faculty?</h2>

<p>We are currently examining staffing levels and workflow to ensure timely delivery to all locations.</p>

<h2>Where can I return my books?&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Books can be returned to <a href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/hours">any Library location</a>. Beginning in January 2020, the rear main library book drop became inaccessible due to construction fencing. New book drops have been added inside the Central Grounds Parking Garage (under the University Bookstore, 400 Emmet St. South) and Ivy Stacks (<span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>2450 Old Ivy Road</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>).&nbsp;</p>

<h2><span>What additional study spaces will be available while the space is closed?</span></h2>

<p>We are collaborating with other spaces on central Grounds to help students have useful places to work. Some examples of expanded study spaces include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The first floor of Clemons&nbsp;is now renovated and re-opened with tables, booths, and compact shelving which holds a&nbsp;large browsing collection.</li>
	<li>Rotunda hours are being extended into late night during exams, when demand for study space is highest. Meeting rooms in Special Collections are also being made available.</li>
	<li>In Newcomb Hall, various additional areas are being made available for study during evening hours, including some dining spaces and lounges.</li>
</ul>

<p>We've also created a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/study-spaces">Study Spaces Map</a> to help students identify places nearby that they may not have previously been aware of.</p>

<h2>When do I need to vacate my study carrel?&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Study carrels were vacated at the end of Fall semester, 2019. The graduate student lounge also closed at this time&nbsp;because of its proximity to preliminary construction work being done in Old Stacks. Please&nbsp;<a href="mailto:sh2rd@virginia.edu">contact Stephanie Hunter</a> if you have more questions about study carrels.</p>

<h2 id="liaison-location">Where will Subject Specialists (departmental liaisons) be located while the main library is closed?</h2>

<p>The liaisons will be across from the Math Library in Kerchoff Hall and they will have a room in New Cabell Hall to meet with students, have office hours, and provide other consultation services. <a href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/staff">Find your subject specialist.&nbsp;</a></p>

<h2>Where can I find documents pertaining to the renovation project?</h2>

<p>The renovation&nbsp;has been a University goal for more than decade, and in that time various engineering studies, historic structure reports, design documents, and other materials have been produced.&nbsp;<a href="/renovation/project-planning-documents/archive">View the full archive of documentation. </a></p>

<h2>Who is included in the project's planning committees?</h2>

<p>A <a href="/renovation/project-planning-documents/committees">number of committees</a> will help steer the renovation as it gets underway.</p>
