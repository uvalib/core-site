<p><span><span><span><strong><em><span><span>Understanding Difference</span></span></em></strong><span><span>—Misunderstandings along political, racial, social, or economic lines often arise from divergent life experiences. We must make an effort to seek out and understand life experiences different from our own if we expect to appreciate and benefit from diversity. In 2017, the University Librarian asked all staff members to make an effort, at least once a year, to enter into conversation with someone whose life experience is significantly different from their own. After getting manager approval, staff may attend workshops, lectures, or films, read books, listen to podcasts, or watch documentaries that bring some particular difference into focus, and they must enter into conversation with someone whose life experience is reflected in the activity and document the occasion in the annual review process. Librarians have responded with an outpouring of ideas and opportunities, now published and regularly updated in an <span><span><a href="https://guides.lib.virginia.edu/UnderstandingDifference">online guide</a></span></span>.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong><em><span><span>Training and seminars</span></span></em></strong><span><span>—We work closely with the offices of the Provost, Vice President &amp; Chief Diversity Officer, and African-American Affairs to be educated by speakers and consultants who research and study racism. For instance, Professor <span><span><a href="https://www.speakoutnow.org/speaker/jacqueline-battalora">Jacqueline Battalora</a></span></span> of Saint Xavier University (author of&nbsp;<em>Birth of a White Nation: The Invention of White People and Its Relevance Today</em>) spoke to Library staff about the American origin of the term “white people”—used by colonial governments controlled by land-owning elites to divide white workers from a multi-ethnic working class with the false premise that Europeans stood at the top of a racial hierarchy with rights denied to African and Native Americans. In fact, race has no biological nor genetic meaning in humans: there is no branching of the human family tree.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong><em><span><span>Accessibility</span></span></em></strong><span><span>—The UVA Library is leading an effort to build a national infrastructure for sharing learning materials accessible for students with print disabilities.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong><em><span><span>Cultural events</span></span></em></strong><span><span>—We actively participate in UVA celebrations of Martin Luther King Day and collaborate with professional school librarians, other academic units, schools and student groups to celebrate Black History Month and other events. We also mark the major holidays of world religions on our home page, with an eye to increasing general awareness of other religions and cultures.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong><em><span><span>Global Initiative Group (GIG)</span></span></em></strong><span><span>—This is a Library-based pan-University network devoted to global art, policy, education, and outreach. It has collaborated with the Center for the Americas, Center for Latin-American Studies, and the Global Health Center on programming.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong><em><span><span>Jefferson School African American Heritage Center</span></span></em></strong><strong><span><span>—</span></span></strong><span><span>We’re a sponsor of this <span><span><a href="https://jeffschoolheritagecenter.org/">rich community resource</a></span></span>. In July 2018, three Library staffers joined the&nbsp;<span><span><a href="https://news.library.virginia.edu/2018/07/13/civil-rights-pilgrimage-a-personal-journey-for-library-employees/">Charlottesville Civil Rights Pilgrimage</a></span></span>, organized by UVA Religious Studies professor Jalane Schmidt, and Andrea Douglas, Executive Director at the African American Heritage Center, to deliver soil from the site of a local lynching to the National Memorial for Peace and Justice in Montgomery, AL.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
