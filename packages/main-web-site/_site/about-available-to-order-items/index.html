<p>Our Available to Order service enhances&nbsp;the way we currently acquire books for the Library’s permanent collection by inviting&nbsp;you to participate in our collection building. Librarians curate selections&nbsp;of books&nbsp;beyond our usual purchases, which are then made available as Virgo catalog records. Should you choose to order these items, the Library will purchase them to become part of our collection.</p>

<p>This service&nbsp;allows you to choose books you need for your research and scholarship from right inside the Library catalog.</p>

<h3>What are Available to Order books?</h3>
