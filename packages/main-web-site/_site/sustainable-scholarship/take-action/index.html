<p>Anyone who shares UVA Library's commitment to sustainable scholarship has the power to act to move scholarly publishing in a better direction. Here are some of the steps people are already taking to promote change from a variety of roles in the scholarly ecosystem:</p>

<h2 id="TakeAction-Authors">Authors</h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Share your<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preprint">&nbsp;preprints</a></strong>&nbsp;in a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preprint#Servers_by_field">disciplinary repository</a>. If your discipline doesn't have an established preprint repository, you can use&nbsp;<a href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/libra/open/">LibraOpen</a>.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Publish your articles in Open Access journals</strong>, which make the final published version available for free online. Reputable OA journals exist in almost every field.&nbsp;Find guidance and lists at&nbsp;<a href="http://thinkchecksubmit.org/check/">Think, Check, Submit</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://doaj.org/">Directory of Open Access Journals</a>. (Note: beware&nbsp;<a href="https://www.liberquarterly.eu/article/10.18352/lq.10280/">unsustainable Article Processing Charges</a>! Most OA journals do not charge fees at all, some charge reasonable fees, and some journals use their prestige to overcharge. Consider alternatives below rather than paying high fees.)</li>
	<li><strong>Self-archive</strong>&nbsp;<strong>your work</strong>&nbsp;if you publish in a subscription journal:
	<ul>
		<li>Most publishers permit you to share your work, as long as you share the right version and comply with any embargo period. You can check your journal's policy on self-archiving at&nbsp;<a href="https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/">Sherpa-Romeo</a>.&nbsp;</li>
		<li>If your journal's policy is unclear or inconsistent with sharing, you can&nbsp;negotiate the terms of your author agreement to retain your copyright — the&nbsp;<a href="https://sparcopen.org/our-work/author-rights/brochure-html/">SPARC Author Addendum</a>&nbsp;helps start this conversation.</li>
		<li>Once you know your rights, share the appropriate version of your work in<a href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/libra/">&nbsp;LibraOpen&nbsp;</a>(and your data in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/libra/datasets/">LibraData</a>).</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="TakeAction-FacultyPolicymakers">Faculty Policymakers</h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong><a href="https://sfdora.org/read/">Reform promotion and tenure</a></strong>&nbsp;in your school or department to ensure they are better-aligned with your values.&nbsp;Learn about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/news/beat-it-impact-factor-publishing-elite-turns-against-controversial-metric-1.20224">criticisms of journal impact factors</a>&nbsp;and why they are a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/062109v2">poor way to assess</a>&nbsp;research quality.</li>
	<li><strong>Consider a&nbsp;<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/hoap/Good_practices_for_university_open-access_policies">Harvard-style Open Access policy</a></strong>, which can be adopted at the university level or by individual schools. These policies help give authors leverage to retain their copyrights and share their work, even when they publish in traditional, paywalled journals.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://declaring-independence.org/letter-from-an-editor.html"><strong>“Declare Independence”</strong>&nbsp;</a>and make your journal open access,&nbsp;or start a new open journal. Either way, our open publishing initiative&nbsp;<a href="https://aperio.press/">Aperio</a>&nbsp;can help.</li>

	<li><strong>Install browser plug-ins</strong>&nbsp;like&nbsp;<a href="https://openaccessbutton.org/">Open Access Button</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://unpaywall.org/">Unpaywall</a>&nbsp;that help you find legal free versions of articles online.</li>
	<li><strong>Familiarize yourself</strong>&nbsp;with other&nbsp;<a href="https://confluence.lib.virginia.edu/display/SSWG/Continuing+Access+to+Journal+Articles">alternative access</a>&nbsp;services, like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/services/ils/ill/">interlibrary loan</a>, that can get you the research you need without costly subscriptions.</li>
