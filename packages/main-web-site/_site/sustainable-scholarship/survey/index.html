<p>As part of the process to review Elsevier journals at the University of Virginia, the Library has designed a survey for UVA affiliates. We would like to hear how you use specific Elsevier journal titles for instruction, research, and/or patient care.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This survey will close on January&nbsp;1. Please respond for yourself as an individual, not on behalf of a division or a department. You may review as many journals as you wish.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>You will be logged in through Netbadge after clicking the survey link below, and y</strong><strong>ou can pause and return to the survey any time.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<h2>Thanks for your interest, but the survey is now closed.&nbsp;</h2>
