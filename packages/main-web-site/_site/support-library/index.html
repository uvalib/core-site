        <p class="bigFirstLetter">The University of Virginia was conceived with a library at its heart, placed in the Rotunda at the head of the Academical Village. Today, the Library’s original purpose is unchanged: to provide access to accumulated
          knowledge, and in doing so, to increase it. Your gift to the Library helps us to acquire, preserve, organize, and share materials vital to the research and teaching needs of the scholarly community, and to maintain the spaces and services
          necessary to further our purpose.</p>

            <h3>Main Library Renovation</h3>
            <p>Scholars throughout the University and beyond depend on the main library for access to collections, support for scholarship and research, and the expertise of librarians, curators, technologists, and other specialized staff. A major
              renovation will not only modernize the building and correct safety and infrastructure issues, it will create an accessible environment that is welcoming to all and rebuild and restore the library that has become an iconic symbol of the
              intellectual experience at the University of Virginia.</p>
