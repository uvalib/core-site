In 1898, four miles from downtown Charlottesville, John Henry James was pulled from a train car, hanged from a tree, and left for hours for all to see. His grave remains unmarked. </p>
<p>Beginning July 8, 2018, a group of about 100 individuals boarded a bus to Montgomery, Alabama. There, they&rsquo;ll deliver soil from James&rsquo; lynching site to the <em>National Memorial for Peace and Justice</em>, where it will be displayed in a memorial alongside hundreds of others who met the same violent end. </p>
<p>Sixteen UVA staff members were sponsored by UVA's Provost to join the pilgrimage, and three members of the Library community have joined in the journey: Trayc Freeman, Sony Prosper, and Eze Amos will be experiencing the pilgrimage and sharing their stories. </p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be featuring updates from the journey here, and we encourage you to follow these individuals as they undertake a trip informing a violent and influential element of American history. </p>

The soil came up easily at the lynching site. Scoop after scoop of deep brown earth dug carefully with a trowel and then gently poured into gallon-size glass jars etched with a name—John Henry James—and a date—July 12, 1898.</p>
<p>….The ceremony was held in a grove of trees between the railroad tracks and a narrow gravel road on land now owned by a country club. This was where James was pulled from a train 120 years ago, hanged from a locust tree, shot by a mob and then left for hours for everyone to see. He was buried in a cemetery in an unmarked grave. It&rsquo;s not known if he ever had a funeral. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/sacred-ground-now-reclaimed-a-charlottesville-story/2018/07/07/a2d12d0c-7e12-11e8-b0ef-fffcabeff946_story.html?utm_term=.6d28f70b5a4f">READ MORE →</a></p>
