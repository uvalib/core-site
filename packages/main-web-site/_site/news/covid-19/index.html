<h2 id="access">Access to Materials</h2>

<p><strong>HathiTrust Emergency Temporary Access Service</strong><br />
A huge portion of UVA’s print collection is newly available online. Use the HathiTrust interface to <strong>log in with your UVA Netbadge credentials</strong> and search for a digital copy of your needed item. More than half of UVA’s print collection is now available this way, and will remain so through spring 2021. <a href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/services/etas">Read step-by-step for using HathiTrust ETAS materials.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p><strong>For Physical Items: Paging and Pickup</strong><br />
This process allows faculty, staff, and students to check out physical materials by making a request in the Virgo catalog and picking up materials at a Library location.&nbsp;</p>

<p>No appointment needed: simply place a request in the Virgo catalog. You will receive an email when your item is ready. Items will be held for 10 days, and are available for pickup during the library’s open hours.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/services/request">Learn how to make a request in Virgo.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p><strong>No Stacks Browsing available; use Paging and Pickup or HathiTrust ETAS</strong><br />
Stacks browsing is not available for spring 2021. Stacks must remain closed in order to comply with copyright law as we participate in the HathiTrust Emergency Temporary Access Service, which provides critical equitable support for faculty, staff, and students, regardless of their location.&nbsp;</p>

Instructional and research scanning are both now underway. You may request items online or <a href="https://guides.lib.virginia.edu/subjectlibrarians">contact your subject liaison</a>&nbsp;for assistance.

<p><strong>Library Stacks</strong><br />
No stacks browsing will be available in fall 2020 or spring 2021.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Brown&nbsp;</strong>and<strong>&nbsp;Clemons&nbsp;</strong>library locations<strong>&nbsp;</strong>are&nbsp;now open&nbsp;for UVA students, faculty, and staff.&nbsp;You must&nbsp;<strong>bring your UVA ID</strong>&nbsp;to gain access.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/hours">View hours now.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The<strong>&nbsp;Special Collections&nbsp;</strong>reading room is open by appointment to current UVA faculty, staff, and students. We regret that we cannot accommodate those without an active UVA ID at this time. To visit,&nbsp;<a href="https://small.library.virginia.edu/services/by-appointment/">request materials in Virgo and make an appointment using our online calendar</a>.</p>

<p>All other spaces are closed.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/map/current-services">See a map of all current Library locations (PDF).&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>Our decisions to open spaces will be informed to a significant degree by guidelines set by UVA and the Commonwealth of Virginia. We are doing everything in our power to be able to move quickly and safely.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="FAQ">FAQ</h2>

<p><strong>How do I get access to Library spaces?&nbsp;</strong><br />
You will need your UVA ID to gain access to University buildings. Some patrons (especially faculty) may have older IDs, and will need to contact the ID office (434-924-4508, uvaID@virginia.edu) to pick up a new one that will enable access.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You need to have the version of an ID with embedded chip and antenna. These IDs:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Have a small clear impression of Rotunda on the front.</li>
	<li>Show a series of numbers on the back under barcode.</li>
	<li>Usually include any card issued after 2015.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Can I return books to the Library? </strong><br />
Yes! All book drops are being monitored. <a href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/map/current-services">View a map of current book drop locations (PDF). </a></p>

<p><strong>I returned my book but I’m still getting overdue notices!</strong><br />
If it’s only been a few days, no need to worry. We’re quarantining materials when they arrive so they are not immediately checked in. Your account will be updated shortly and there will be no penalties to you. If it’s been a week or more since you returned the item and you’re still receiving notices, or if you have other questions, please email <a href="mailto:lib-circ@virginia.edu">lib-circ@virginia.edu</a> for assistance. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Can I reserve a room in library spaces?</strong><br />
Unfortunately, we are not able to offer room reservations this semester.</p>

<p><strong>Do I need an appointment to come study in library spaces?&nbsp;</strong><br />
Nope! Just stop by during <a href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/hours">hours of operation</a>. Note that you must <strong>bring your UVA ID</strong> to gain access.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>When can I browse the stacks?&nbsp;</strong><br />
The Library is committed to maintaining “pickup” services to support the safety and well-being of UVA students, faculty, and staff, by enabling physical access to collections while protecting our participation in the ETAS program. When occupancy and social distancing restrictions are lifted, “pickup” services will revert to normal stacks access.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Why can’t I get physical access to some of the Library’s print collection?&nbsp;</strong><br />
Our agreement with the HathiTrust Emergency Temporary Access Service (ETAS) allows us to extend the reach of our print collection across time and space, to scholars wherever they are located. However, because of copyright law, the Library cannot circulate more copies of a book than what we own. This means that a digital copy available through ETAS <em>is</em> the Library’s circulating copy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The good news is that millions of items are <a href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/services/etas">available digitally through ETAS</a>, to anyone with current Netbadge credentials through UVA! Our participation in HathiTrust ETAS will continue through spring 2021.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Can I use interlibrary loan?&nbsp;</strong><br />
Interlibrary Loan is functional, but the number of institutions able to participate is limited. We have many ways to try to connect you to items you need and will do everything we can to help!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>I have an ILL item checked out and it is overdue. What do I do?&nbsp;</strong><br />
You cannot request renewals through the system once an item is overdue, but our staff can. <a href="mailto:4leo@virginia.edu">Email us </a>with the Transaction Number(s) and we can request a renewal for you. Even if the request is denied, there are no overdue fines, and you can plan to keep the item until you are able to return it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you would like to return the item through the mail, <a href="/return-label">download a postage-paid label (PDF)</a>and send items through USPS. Email <a href="mailto:4leo@virginia.edu">4leo@virginia.edu</a> as needed for assistance.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Can I access UVA "stuff" from off-Grounds?</strong><br />
Yes! Many digital tools (including Library resources) will require you to have a VPN installed. <a href="https://virginia.service-now.com/its?id=itsweb_kb_article&amp;sys_id=f24e5cdfdb3acb804f32fb671d9619d0">Read more and install a VPN now.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p><strong>If you are away from UVA and need internet access...</strong><br />
UVA is an eduroam member, which means that students or instructors who have UVA WiFi set up on their computers can access the internet at a large number of other eduroam institutions in their home towns. <a href="https://www.incommon.org/eduroam/eduroam-u-s-locator-map/">See a full map.</a></p>

<p>This situation is rapidly evolving, but <strong>local public libraries </strong>usually offer free internet, and local colleges or universities may offer additional flexibility.</p>

<p><strong>How does the Library make decisions about quarantining materials?</strong><br />
The Library is following the Reopening Archives, Libraries, and Museums (REALM) project closely to inform our quarantine decisions for the collection, while recognizing that no actions eliminate all risk of exposure to the COVID-19 virus.</p>

<p>The REALM project “draws upon research to produce authoritative, science-based information on how — or if — materials can be handled to mitigate exposure to staff and visitors.” <a href="https://www.webjunction.org/explore-topics/COVID-19-research-project.html">Read more about REALM and their latest reports.</a></p>

<p>The Library has robust safety protocols which include quarantining materials, use of PPE, and minimizing high-risk interactions, in addition to UVA’s regular cleaning schedule. <strong>However, as usual, proceed at your own risk — please use facial coverings, wash your hands often, and practice social distancing. </strong>Given the ongoing risk of infection, we recommend that all patrons and staff follow <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html">precautions recommended by the CDC </a>to stop spread of the virus.</p>
