<h2>A robust scholarly repository that puts your UVA research center stage.</h2>

<p>Announcing LibraOpen, the newest part of UVA’s Libra Scholarly Repository service at&nbsp;<a href="http://libra.virginia.edu/">libra.virginia.edu</a>, opening up a world of options for propagating your scholarship.</p>

<h3>What’s new?</h3>

<ul>
	<li>LibraOpen accepts an ever-growing range of scholarly output,</li>
	<li>creates an immediate, persistent, worldwide-discoverable URL for your work,</li>
	<li>and allows you to easily and definitively claim and connect your scholarship using an&nbsp;<a href="/services/orcid-at-uva/">ORCID iD</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why use LibraOpen?</h3>

<p>Current scholarship is not one size fits all. LibraOpen supports a broad range of deposit types: Presenting a poster about your work at a conference? Upload the poster to Libra and use the resulting persistent link in citations or other scholarly work! Have a recording of your presentation in another institution? Great—create an entry with a link to the media and make your work visible worldwide! Of course, your published and pre- print articles go into LibraOpen as always.</p>

<p>When you deposit work in Libra, Libra creates a persistent URL for your work (“DOI”), that is immediately available for sharing and promotion. Within 24 hours of depositing material in Libra, your work is discoverable through Virgo. Beyond UVA, the entry is immediately discoverable by search engines and thus is available for educators, scholars, and the public, all around the world.</p>

<h3>ORCID: Claim your work!</h3>

<p>“Which Jane Smith are you again?”<br />
Libra offers <a href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/services/orcid-at-uva/">ORCID iDs to connect </a>your scholarship to you via persistent digital identifier, in addition to your name. Your ORCID iD ensures that you are connected to your scholarly contributions “across disciplines, borders, and time.” For general information on ORCIDs see&nbsp;<a href="http://orcid.org/">orcid.org</a>.</p>

<h3>Is your work in another open repository?</h3>

<p>Great! LibraOpen allows you to create entries with embedded links to Open Access content stored in other repositories. This allows you to keep the “master” copy with a discipline-based repository (like arXiv or MLA Commons) and increases exposure through tools like Google Scholar and&nbsp;<a href="http://search.lib.virginia.edu/catalog?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;sort_key=received&amp;author=&amp;call_number=&amp;catalog_select=catalog&amp;f%5Bsource_facet%5D%5B%5D=Libra+Repository&amp;journal=&amp;keyword=&amp;op=AND&amp;publication_date_end=&amp;publication_date_start=&amp;published=&amp;search_field=advanced&amp;sort=score+desc%2C+year_multisort_i+desc&amp;subject=&amp;title=">Virgo</a>.</p>

<h3>What about data sets and student scholarship?</h3>

<p><a href="/libra/datasets/">LibraData</a>&nbsp;(UVA’s Dataverse instance) and&nbsp;<a href="/libra/etds/">LibraETD</a>&nbsp;are well-established homes for this content. Dataverse is a powerful mechanism to share, publish, and archive your data. Libra for Electronic Theses/Dissertations (“LibraETD”) provides safe and secure storage for UVA student theses and dissertations. Submitting work through LibraETD is a graduation requirement for all graduate students whose programs have required theses, and recommended for all students whose programs have optional theses.</p>

<p>If you’ve placed work into Libra in the past, don’t worry! Older URLs remain functional, and we’ve migrated your work to our newest platform. Want to see? Take a look in&nbsp;<a href="http://search.lib.virginia.edu/catalog?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;sort_key=received&amp;author=&amp;call_number=&amp;catalog_select=catalog&amp;f%5Bsource_facet%5D%5B%5D=Libra+Repository&amp;journal=&amp;keyword=&amp;op=AND&amp;publication_date_end=&amp;publication_date_start=&amp;published=&amp;search_field=advanced&amp;sort=score+desc%2C+year_multisort_i+desc&amp;subject=&amp;title=">Virgo</a>!</p>
