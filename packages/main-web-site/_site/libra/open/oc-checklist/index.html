<h3>Before Creating a New LibraOpen Work</h3>

<p><strong>1. Review&nbsp;<a href="http://copyright.library.virginia.edu/copyright-resources/essentials/">Copyright Essentials for Scholarly Work</a></strong></p>

<p>A clear understanding of your rights as an author will be important as you ready your scholarship for deposit in LibraOpen, both in understanding how and when you can use copyrighted third-party content in your own work, and in understanding your rights and opportunities to share your work as the author or copyright owner.</p>

<p><strong>2. Check which version you can deposit</strong></p>

<p>If your article has been previously published, or will be published in a non-Open journal, check the journal’s policy on which version of your work you can deposit into LibraOpen. The web site&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/search.php">SHERPA/RoMEO</a>&nbsp;allows you to search via journal name to see journals’ self-deposit (self-archiving) policies. If you have any questions, please e-mail&nbsp;<a href="mailto:libra@virginia.edu">libra@virginia.edu</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>3. Know your open license options</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Creative Commons licenses are a key tool of the&nbsp;<a href="http://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/brief.htm">Open Access</a>&nbsp;movement, which works to expand free online access to scholarship. The Authors Alliance also has a helpful FAQ about&nbsp;<a href="http://www.authorsalliance.org/2014/10/16/open-access-faq/">open access for authors</a>.</li>
	<li>LibraOpen lets you choose an open license&nbsp;when you post your work, and&nbsp;will prominently display the license you choose as part of the record for your work. &nbsp;This license helps readers find your work, and makes it more likely that it will be read and re-used.&nbsp;You should also include the license information among the front pages of the version you deposit.</li>
	<li>Creative Commons licenses allow copyright holders to grant blanket permission to the public to make free use of their works, so long as the use meets certain conditions (such as attribution, or refraining from commercial exploitation). Learn about&nbsp;CC license options at the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a>&nbsp;website.</li>
	<li>Creative Commons licenses are&nbsp;<strong>irrevocable</strong>—once you publish the work to the web with a CC license attached, you are bound by those terms and anyone who complies with them is free to use your work accordingly. So,&nbsp;<strong>think carefully</strong>&nbsp;about how you want to make your work available for reuse before you choose an open license.</li>
	<li>LibraOpen also lets you choose a traditional “All rights reserved” license.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>4. Prepare an abstract and keywords</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>An abstract is required for submission to Libra. If your work&nbsp;does not already have an abstract, use a word processing or text editing program to create and save at least a paragraph describing your scholarship&nbsp;to potential readers. Copy and paste your abstract into the submission form.</li>
	<li>Keywords are optional but recommended. Select at least 2 to 3 keywords that best describe the content of your work. Keywords can be taken from the abstract and/or title. Individual words and/or phrases may be used. Use keywords that will be easily recognized by others in your discipline.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Deposit&nbsp;Your Work to Libra</h3>

<ul>
	<li>An&nbsp;<a href="https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/categories/360000663034">ORCID</a>&nbsp;iD is a unique researcher identifier, used worldwide, that you can keep throughout your life and retain even if you move institutions. It distinguishes you from other researchers, even if they have the same name, and enables authoritative links to be created between you and your research activities.</li>
	<li>Create or link your ORCID iD in&nbsp;<a href="https://libraopen.lib.virginia.edu/">LibraOpen</a>&nbsp;by clicking the “Create or Connect Your ORCID ID” button on your dashboard (main) page in LibraOpen.

<h3>After Your Work is Open</h3>

	<li>24 hours after deposit, you may check that your scholarship was successfully added to the Library’s collection by searching for your work&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href="http://search.lib.virginia.edu/catalog?complete=true&amp;f%5Bsource_facet%5D%5B%5D=Libra+Repository&amp;facet.limit=500&amp;id=source_facet&amp;op=AND&amp;search_field=advanced&amp;sort=score+desc%2C+year_multisort_i+desc&amp;width=490">Virgo</a>, the UVA online library catalog.</li>
