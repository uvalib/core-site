<p>By depositing research data in a Dataverse repository (including LibraData) researchers can fulfill funding agency requirements for data management and sharing plans as well as journal sharing requirements.</p>

<p>Being able to share data or your products of research starts with managing your research [data].&nbsp; Creation of a data management plan is a "best practice" for research projects that involve the collection or dissemination of data. Data management plans help to insure that data collected by a project have the integrity, quality, and provenance needed to support the proposed research; and that data necessary for external replication of research findings will be available to the research community.&nbsp;</p>
