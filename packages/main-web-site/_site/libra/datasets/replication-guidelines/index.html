<p>Many journals, publishers, and funding agencies require researchers to deposit replication datasets in a public repository. LibraData helps researchers fulfill this requirement by supporting the deposit of&nbsp;replication datasets, making this special type of data easily discoverable for other researchers to reuse and verify that a study can be replicated without having to contact the study's authors. Contact <a href="mailto:libra@virginia.edu">libra@virginia.edu</a>&nbsp;if you have any questions on what should be included in your LibraData dataset.</p>

<p>When setting up a replication dataset in LibraData here are some helpful guidelines to follow:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Be sure to include all the necessary descriptive metadata (description, methods, data sources, etc) that would make it easier for other researchers to discover your replication dataset. For example:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Publication citation:</strong> include a permanent link to the original publication(s) (e.g., journal article, dissertation, etc) based on the data.</li>
		<li><strong>Data Citation Details:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Title of the Dataset</li>
			<li>Author(s)</li>
			<li>Publication date: automatically generated in a Dataverse repository when you publish your Dataset.</li>
			<li>Persistent Identifier (DOI): automatically generated in a&nbsp;Dataverse repository when you create a Dataset.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Description and Scope:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Description/abstract taken directly from your publication.</li>
			<li>Keywords</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Data Collection / Methodology:</strong> Add more descriptive metadata to explain how the data was collected and analyzed.</li>
		<li><strong>License + Terms of Access:</strong> In order to reduce all limitations to sharing and reuse LibraData&nbsp;recommends whenever possible that your Datasets have a <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC0_use_for_data">CC0&nbsp;public domain dedication</a>. Our Community Norms as well as good scientific practices require that proper credit is given via citation.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Make sure you add <strong>all relevant files</strong> (Research Data, Documentation, Code and Analysis Files) in a replication Dataset in LibraData.
	<ul>
		<li>List of code, scripts, documents and data files that are needed in order to make replication possible.</li>
		<li>Deposit preferred or commonly used file formats in your discipline to ensure that others will be able to more easily replicate your research. Please remember to remove information from your datasets that must remain confidential (ex. names of survey respondents). For <strong>Astronomy/Astrophysics</strong>: FITS files with image metadata stored in a human-readable ASCII header. For the <strong>Social Sciences</strong>: Original SPSS, STATA, R files, csv, xslx, etc with variable names and description.</li>
		<li>Sets of computer program recodes (if needed).</li>
		<li>Program commands, code or script for analysis (if needed).</li>
		<li>Extracts of existing publicly available data (or very clear directions for how to obtain exactly the same ones you used).</li>
		<li>Documentation files (full set of supporting documentation)
		<ul>
			<li>“readme” file (explanatory document on how to use the files to replicate the study)</li>
			<li>Text/pdf file of the article (if no subscription required).</li>
			<li>Include a list of links to software or newly generated software used to replicate the data (see Gary King’s website for examples).</li>
			<li>Codebook</li>
			<li>Data collection instruments</li>
			<li>Summary statistics</li>
			<li>Project summaries</li>
			<li>Bibliographies of publications pertaining to the data</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>Use the data citation generated by your replication Dataset in LibraData&nbsp;and add it as the first footnote or in the References within your publication to indicate where researchers can access your replication data. The persistent URL (ex. http://doi.org/...) will link to your specific dataset, and if you have followed these suggestions, the dataset will contain everything needed for replication.</p>
