<p>Why Deposit data in LibraData?</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Increased visibility and impact of your research data.&nbsp;</strong><br />
	Sharing your data publicly can increase your research impact and visibility, creating additional opportunities for collaboration and connection within and beyond your existing network. To assist in the sharing process, a persistent identifier (DOI) is created for each LibraData dataset.</li>
	<li><strong>Safe management of your data.</strong><br />
	Depositing your research data in LibraData not only makes your data discoverable and accessible to a wider audience, but also keeps your data safer. The UVA Library, and UVA’s Information Technology Services, are committed to the durability and sustainability of scholarship deposited in Libra. Libra uses standard data management practices, including security and backup procedures, to provide a reasonable assurance that files will remain retrievable over time. LibraData will be preserved in the&nbsp;<a href="http://aptrust.org/"><strong>Academic Preservation Trust</strong></a>, of which UVA Library is a founding member and partner.</li>
	<li><strong>Fulfillment of journal and grant mandates.</strong><br />
	More journals and public and private&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PYOhBh6bglh6BkQFlpvNLOwlpzvQyguWAG8AkQMtU0s/edit#gid=0"><strong>funding agencies</strong></a>&nbsp;are requiring that researchers deposit data created as part of the research process. Publishing your data within LibraData meets the requirements of these mandates.</li>
	<li><strong>Valuable research time saved.</strong><br />
	Using LibraData’s easy-to-use interface to deposit, describe, and share your data saves you time and allows you to focus on your research.</li>

<strong>LibraData is for <em>publishable</em> products of research.</strong> LibraData is a place for UVA researchers to publish research data for sharing publicly. If you are looking for a home for data in progress, consider using the <a href="https://osf.io/institutions/uva/"><strong>Open Science Framework</strong></a> during the collaborative phase of your research - it integrates easily with instances of Dataverse repositories like LibraData to enable publishing of research products at the appropriate point in the research lifecycle. You can also deposit data into LibraData even if it’s already been made publicly available through another repository. </p>

<p><strong>LibraData is UVA’s local instance</strong> of the Dataverse software developed by Harvard. Since it is locally installed, all data resides on servers physically located on the UVA Grounds.</p>
