<p>Electronic dissertations and masters’ theses have been deposited in the Libra scholarly repository at the University of Virginia since 2012. Libra makes UVA scholarship available to the world and provides safe and secure storage for the scholarly output of the UVA community. Submitting your work to Libra is a graduation requirement for all graduate students whose programs have required theses, and recommended for students whose programs have optional theses.</p>

<p><strong>Before you upload your thesis or dissertation, be sure you have reviewed:</strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://copyright.library.virginia.edu/copyright-resources/essentials/">Copyright Essentials for Scholarly Work</a></strong>&nbsp;(including Graduate Students)</p>

<h3>Older Dissertation Formats</h3>

<p><strong>CD Format</strong></p>

<p>All dissertations submitted to the UVA Library in CD format were deposited into Libra in early 2014. Access to these items is UVA-only, replicating the accessibility level of the originally deposited CDs.</p>

<p>If you are the author of one of these dissertations and would like to change the access level to be world-wide open access, please&nbsp;<a href="mailto:libra@virginia.edu" rel="nofollow">contact us</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Paper Copies</strong></p>

<p>We no longer accept paper copies for the Library shelves.&nbsp; Many frequently requested dissertations from the UVA collection have been added to Libra through a generous grant from Jefferson Trust. If you are the author of one of these dissertations now in Libra and would like to change the access level to be world-wide open access, please&nbsp;<a href="mailto:libra@virginia.edu" rel="nofollow">contact us</a>.</p>

<p>If your dissertation was published in paper previously and you would like it to be added to Libra, please&nbsp;<a href="mailto:libra@virginia.edu" rel="nofollow">contact us</a>.</p>

<p><strong>ProQuest</strong></p>

<p>Many UVA dissertations were deposited in ProQuest until 2012, and some students continue to take the option to deposit to this commercial&nbsp;vendor of databases and other information products. ProQuest’s&nbsp;<a href="http://search.proquest.com/pqdtglobal/dissertations/fromBasicHomePage">Dissertations and Theses Full Text</a>&nbsp;database contains many dissertations published in the U.S. and is used by scholars worldwide whose institutions opt to provide paid access to the database.&nbsp;ProQuest also sells full-text copies of dissertations directly to the public, though it is worth noting they do not share revenue from those sales with authors. NOTE: To access "online" ETD's in Proquest, you must be affiliated with an institution that subscribes to the ProQuest database.</p>

<p>ProQuest charges fees for submission, and they have particular formatting and copyright requirements.&nbsp; Please see their&nbsp;<a href="http://www.proquest.com/products-services/dissertations/submitting-dissertation-proquest.html" target="_blank">submission instructions</a>&nbsp;for details. UVA does not require thesis or dissertation deposit to ProQuest, nor does UVA have an institutional agreement with ProQuest for such deposit. Students who opt to deposit with ProQuest do so as individuals contracting with this vendor.</p>
