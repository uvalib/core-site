<strong>Optional Deposit Form (requires authorization):&nbsp;<a href="https://libraoptional.lib.virginia.edu/">https://libraoptional.lib.virginia.edu/</a></strong>

<p>Students participating in programs with optional (e.g. not tracked through SIS) thesis submission get permission to upload to Libra enabled by their departmental, program or school registrar’s &nbsp;or administrators’ use of this online form.</p>

<p>To help students with the optional deposit, we have prepared a handout on&nbsp;what to expect once logged on to Libra:&nbsp;<strong><a href="/sites/default/files/2020-03/OptionalStudentDeposit.pdf">Depositing Optional Theses to Libra (PDF)</a>.</strong> Please share with your students.</p>

<p>Students can also refer to the&nbsp;<strong><a href="/libra/etds/etds-checklist/">ETD Submission Requirements Checklist</a>&nbsp;</strong>(noting that some information on this page only applies to those depositing theses and dissertations per their graduation requirements).</p>

<h4>Registrars/Administrators, please make sure of the following before entering a student’s information:</h4>

<ol>
	<li>Verify the student’s thesis is optional (e.g. a class or other non-graduation requirement). This form is ONLY for optional theses — students with theses required for graduation MUST have the appropriate SIS milestone set instead. Otherwise the student will not graduate.</li>
	<li>Verify the student has completed all departmental, program or school requirements for thesis approval (departmental/program/school requirements will vary).</li>
	<li>Select the student’s Department/Program/School and Degree being earned.</li>
       <li>In the “User List” box, enter the student’s UVA Computing ID. If you have multiple students earning the same degree from the same department/program/school, you may list multiple UVA Computing IDs in the “User List” box (one ID per line).</li>
	<li>Repeat Steps 1-4 for each set of students with a unique department/program and degree.</li>
	<li>Click Submit.</li>
</ol>

<h4>The student is then enabled to deposit the optional thesis in Libra:</h4>

<ol>
	<li>Each student will receive an email with the LibraETD link indicating they are now eligible to deposit in Libra.</li>
	<li>Upon successful submission, the student and the departmental/program or school registrar or administrator who submitted the Optional Deposit Form will receive an email indicating the student has completed deposit to Libra.</li>
	<li>The student is responsible for notifying his/her instructor or advisor of submission and the persistent URL for the thesis in Libra.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Changes to submitted theses:</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Changes to submitted thesis files are possible ONLY with the advisor/lead professor’s written permission in cases of substantive research errors. It is the student’s responsibility to request the advisor/professor email written permission for the change to <a href="mailto:libra@virginia.edu">libra@virginia.edu</a>.</li>
	<li>Non-substantive metadata changes (typos in name or abstract, etc) for submitted theses do not require faculty permission. Students needing such changes may email requests directly to <a href="mailto:libra@virginia.edu">libra@virginia.edu</a>.</li>
</ul>
