<h3><strong>Electronic Thesis/Dissertation (ETD) Submission Checklist</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Before you can submit your thesis or dissertation, you must receive an e-mail from Libra</strong>&nbsp;with the subject: “<em>Access to upload your approved thesis to LIBRA</em>”. E-mail is sent after your defense milestone has been updated by a Graduate Administrator and Libra receives notice of it.</P>
<P> Use the instructions below to successfully&nbsp;<a href="https://libraetd.lib.virginia.edu/">submit your ETD</a>&nbsp;to Libra.</p>

<h3>Before You&nbsp;Submit</h3>

<p><strong>1. Review Copyright Information</strong></p>

<p>Check out the <a href="https://copyright.library.virginia.edu/copyright-resources/essentials/" target="_blank">Copyright Essentials for Scholarly Work</a> page to get a better understanding of a few key copyright concepts. These will be important as you draft and submit your thesis or dissertation, both in understanding how and when you can use copyrighted third-party content in your own work, and in understanding your rights and opportunities to share your work as the author of your thesis or dissertation.<BR>
<BR>
Thinking about publishing your thesis/dissertation in part or whole, before or after graduation? Check out the <a href="https://libraries.mit.edu/scholarly/publishing/theses-copyright/theses-and-article-publishing/" target="_blank">Publisher Policy Checker</a> from MIT Library. Use this resource to find publisher policies regarding inclusion of previously published articles in theses and dissertations, and policies on accepting journal submissions that first appeared in an author’s previously released thesis or dissertation.</p>

<p><strong>2. Know your school’s instructions</strong></p>

<p>Check with your school for information on the proper process, workflow, and timing for submitting your thesis or dissertation.</p>

<p>Your school will direct you on its process for submitting your work:</p>

</ul>

<p><strong>3. Know your open license options</strong></p>

<p>Libra lets you choose an open license&nbsp;when you post your work, and&nbsp;will prominently display the CC license you choose as part of the record for your work.</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC-BY</a>&nbsp;(permitting free use with proper attribution)</li>
	<li>All rights reserved (no additional license for public reuse) – users who download your work from Libra must comply with ordinary copyright law and seek permission for uses that are not fair use or otherwise permitted by law</li>
</ul>

<p>This license helps readers find your work, and makes it more likely that it will be read and re-used.&nbsp;Review the Creative Commons section of&nbsp;<a href="http://copyright.library.virginia.edu/copyright-resources/essentials/#CC">Copyright Essentials for Scholarly Work</a>&nbsp;for further information.</p>

<p><strong>4. Know your access and visibility options</strong></p>
<p>All graduate students are required to discuss access options with their advisor or committee prior to submitting to Libra. To understand your options, please see the <a href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/libra/etds/authors-rights-embargoes">Access and Visibility Options</a> page.

<p><strong>5. Prepare an abstract and keywords</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	An abstract is required for submission to Libra. It describes&nbsp;your work’s main focus to researchers interested in your topic. Using the abstract already included in&nbsp;your thesis or dissertation is fine. If your thesis&nbsp;does not already have an abstract, use a word processing or text editing program to create and save at least a paragraph describing your thesis to potential readers. Copy and paste your abstract into the submission form.
	</li>
	<li>
	Keywords are optional but encouraged. Select at least 2 to 3 keywords that best describe the content of your thesis or dissertation. Keywords can be taken from the abstract and/or title. Individual words and/or phrases may be used. Use keywords that will be easily recognized by others in your discipline.
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>6. Proofread</strong></p>

<p><strong>You may not delete or change dissertations and theses once they are deposited in Libra</strong>.</p>
