    <p class="h4">The history of the University of Virginia can be divided into three chapters, each marked by the construction of a library.</p>
    <p>The first chapter was marked by the iconic Rotunda, the “temple of knowledge” conceived as the centerpiece of UVA’s transformative educational community.</p>
    <p>The second chapter began in 1938 with the opening of a new building to replace the Rotunda as UVA’s main library. The new library announced a significant push to build collections and a purposeful new commitment to the scholarly enterprise.</p>
    <p>The Library’s next chapter is beginning now, marked by the renovation of the main library as the hub of the flexible library system that UVA needs as it enters its third century.</p>
    <p>Each of these chapters feature new approaches to Library spaces, collections, and services. As the University’s “Honor the Future” campaign continues, the Library is working towards three major campaign goals.</p>

    <h2>Campaign Goals</h2>

        <h3>Renovating our Main Library</h3>
        <p>The 80-plus-year-old building needs an extensive overhaul to bring it up to current standards of safety, accessibility, and service.</p>

        <h3>Improving Collections</h3>
        <p>The Library’s collections are essential to scholarship, and building and enhancing them, as well as strengthening preservation and special collections, is vital to the University.</p>

        <h3>Increasing Access and Affordability</h3>
        <p>Ensuring that our collections, spaces, and services are accessible to all is imperative, and affordability is a key component of access.</p>

    <h2>Giving to the Library</h2>
    <div class="nc-fund">
      <h3>Library Annual Fund</h3>
      <p>Annual giving is vital to the University of Virginia Library. We rely on the generosity of donors each and every year to respond quickly to emerging priorities and critical needs as they arise. Unrestricted gifts &mdash; funds that are not earmarked for a certain purpose and can be used as needed &mdash; provide sustained support for our programs and services, which in turn foster excellence throughout all of UVA’s academic programs.</p>
      <p>Annual gifts support every aspect of the Library’s mission: to strengthen undergraduate learning and research, support faculty scholarship, and further innovation and collaboration. They enhance our collections and physical spaces and promote both collaborative learning and quiet reflection.</p>
      <p>Thank you for your dedication and support as we adapt to the needs of these changing times.</p>
