      <h2>Improving Collections</h2>
      <p>Our rich and varied collections are a jewel of the University and absolutely integral to the educational experience. Collections are an area in which we cannot compromise — we must have adequate funding to build collections, support preservation and conservation, and enhance special collections.</p>
      <p>As the academic landscape evolves, the Library must provide needed materials not only in established fields but also in disciplines that are emerging and expanding. Anticipating future collections needs and investing in the necessary resources to deepen our collections is fundamental to the strength of the Library and to scholarship at the University.</p>
      <p>Collections care is indispensable to the health of our resources. Our Preservation Services department facilitates access to the Library’s collections by maintaining their physical integrity. They repair paper and books, provide binding services, and collaborate on the care and conservation of both circulating and rare materials. We are seeking funds for endowed staffing, significant equipment needs, and the preservation of digitized and born-digital materials including audio, video, animations, 3D models, and many other data types.</p>
      <p>Finally, we must expand and preserve our remarkable special collections. The magnitude and variety of these collections have contributed to making the UVA Library an inviting destination for collections of all types. Gifts to Special Collections and Archives help us not only in acquiring new resources but in processing, cataloging, and exhibiting materials we currently hold.</p>
      <p>Improving collections is vital to furthering the University’s goal of discovery in support of inquiry and scholarship — your contributions will allow us to build collections, make them discoverable, and share our resources with scholars in the University community and beyond.</p>
