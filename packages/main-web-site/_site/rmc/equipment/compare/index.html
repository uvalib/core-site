<img alt="" data-align="right" data-caption="Zoom Q4" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="e02e29e5-8668-49c8-844e-a0d3047583dc" src="/sites/default/files/inline-images/zoom-q4.jpg" />
<p>The <strong>Zoom Q4</strong> is best for recording events where high-quality audio is important but zooming and pixel perfect image quality is not. The High-Quality wide-angle lens captures multiple video formats and frame rates which allows the Q4 to record sharp, detailed images in multiple lighting environments. The Q4 captures AAC and WAV audio formats up to 24-bit/96k through the built-in stereo X/Y microphone, with three different mic gain options, and an windscreen for capturing audio while minimizing wind rumble. The camera also features an input for 1/8th inch jack external microphones, a built-in speaker and a line-level/headphone output with dedicated volume control for monitoring.</p>

<p>The USB interface allows for charging, data transfer to and from computer editing software, webcam functionality, and live streaming with USTREAM Producer, Flash Live Media Encoder, and Skype. There is also an USB mic function for use with external devices like computers.</p>

<p><em>No reservation required.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>The <strong>Canon VIXIA HF R600</strong> is a great all-around camera that will capture HD video and high-quality audio. The Vixia allows you to easily capture clear, high quality audio with multiple audio modes.&nbsp; Each mode has optimized settings suited for various needs, which results in HD video with realistic, immersive audio. The camcorder is equipped with an advanced 3.28 Megapixel Full HD CMOS Image Sensor to capture lifelike true Full HD 1920 x 1080 resolution video. The high-resolution HD CMOS Image Sensor delivers natural color even in low light, noise reduction to bring bright clarity to every frame, plus it looks clear and detailed anywhere you view it, including large HDTVs. The camera also features an input for external 1/8in jack microphones, a built-in speaker and a line-level/headphone output with dedicated volume control for monitoring.</p>

<p>The USB interface exclusively allows for data transfer to computer editing software via the included USB cable.</p>

<p>The <strong>Canon&nbsp;EOS C100</strong>&nbsp;is equipped with an advanced 16:9 Super 35mm Canon CMOS Image Sensor. The large sensor format allows for cinematic image capture by providing depth of field control and dynamic range characteristics reminiscent of film. The 8.3 megapixel sensor maximizes pixel pitch for greater sensitivity in low light while minimizing noise. The sensor allows the&nbsp;EOS C100&nbsp;to capture Red, Green, and Blue channels independent to achieve Full HD 1920x1080 video.</p>

<p>The camera also features:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Canon Log Gamma which preserves shadow and highlight detail for maximum editing and grading in post without image degradation</li>
	<li>Wide DR Gamma with high dynamic range that suppresses brightness while maintaining seamless gradations.</li>
	<li>AVCHD File Based Recording to SD Cards</li>
	<li>A maximum bit-rate of 24Mbps (LPCM) at a maximum resolution of 1920x1080. Frame rates of 60i, PF30, PF24, 24p, 50i, and 25p.</li>
	<li>Relay Recording of long takes between dual SD cards</li>
	<li>Dual slot Recording using both cards in case of a SD card failure.</li>
	<li>Complete manual control of every recording process.</li>
	<li>ND filters expand control over exposure and depth-of-field.</li>
	<li>Focusing aids (Peaking Modes and Magnify Focus Modes) to confirm critical focus distance</li>
	<li>One-Shot AF to assist in sudden focusing adjustments</li>
	<li>Push Auto Iris to automatically adjust aperture to easily maintain proper exposure in frequent lighting changes.</li>
	<li>2 External XLR Mic inputs and a stereo in camera mic</li>
