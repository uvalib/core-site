            Yes, Yes, without the oops! Just my luck, no ice. Checkmate... Checkmate... Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist? This thing comes fully loaded.

            Hey, you know how I&#x2019;m, like, always trying to save the planet? Here&#x2019;s my chance. Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye! What do they got in there? King Kong? Did he just throw my cat out of the window? Must go faster.
