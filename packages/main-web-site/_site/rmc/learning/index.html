      <h3>Equipment Training</h3>
      <p>Much of <a href="https://cal.lib.virginia.edu/reserve/equipment/rmc">RMC’s equipment</a> is first-come, first-served and doesn’t require specialty training. (Of course, our helpful staff and student consultants are always available for questions!) But some RMC equipment&nbsp;does require a bit of basic training before use.</p>
      <p><strong>Not sure if you need tutorials?</strong> Any training requirements are listed alongside the equipment information.</p>
      <p>Training is generally a two-step process:</p>
      <ol>
      	<li>Complete online training modules (these are available any time if you need a refresher later on), and</li>
      	<li>Complete an in-person assessment. The assessment is simply intended to make sure you’re aware of our policies and basic operation of the equipment, and to give you a chance to ask questions before being granted access to the reservation system.&nbsp;</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Remember:</strong>&nbsp;walk-in support for digital media is always available at the&nbsp;RMC. Just ask for help at the front desk (3rd floor of Clemons Library) and our friendly staff will be at your service!</p>
