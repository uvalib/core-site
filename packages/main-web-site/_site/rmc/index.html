          <p>The RMC is all about creativity. Located on the third floor of Clemons Library, the RMC fosters innovations in learning and creation by providing space, equipment, and expertise to support audiovisual production, 3D data processing, 3D fabrication, and virtual and augmented reality. Staff offer individual consultations and group training to help students with their projects and assist faculty in the design of innovative assignments.</p>
          <p>Students are front and center in the planning and running of the RMC. A student advisory group provides input on planning and operations, and a dedicated corps of student staffers provides the bulk of the support for daily operations. Students assist, train, troubleshoot, and fix. Our student staff are also some of our most accomplished makers, leading the way with their experimental approaches to creating new work.</p>
          <p>All students are welcome in this space, no matter their level of knowledge or expertise. Staff are committed to meeting students at their own level and helping them to develop the skills that allow for self-expression in a variety of media.</p>
