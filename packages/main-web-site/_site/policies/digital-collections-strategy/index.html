<p><span><span><span>The University of Virginia Library collects, organizes, preserves, and provides access to rich and varied resources in support of the research and teaching missions of the University. Its collection is not static but rather adaptable in response to past, current, and future needs of the University. The Library aligns its approach to the University’s strategic priorities by collecting a broad range of materials to support excellence in leadership, scholarship, and global engagement.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The collection development and management strategy expressed here guides the work of the Collections Management Team, operating in collegial collaboration with the Digital Library Collections Advisory Team, Library subject liaisons, Library Preservation Services, and University faculty to provide access to information, images, data, music, time-based media, etc. It is designed to provide a framework for digital collection development, management, and preservation while remaining flexible and responsive to changing University and Library priorities.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Through its collections, <em>regardless of current or original format</em>, the Library affirms the University’s commitment to the advancement, preservation, and dissemination of knowledge in a facilitative, accessible, inclusive, and impartial environment. Accordingly, the Library’s digital collection management strategy:</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>advocates intellectual freedom in support of diverse points of view and confidential, equitable access to information;</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>respects intellectual property and author rights in current and emerging methods of scholarly output;</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>endorses open access and digital initiatives in scholarly publication and communication;</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>focuses on content which can be freely shared;</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>considers broad types of data and information, including non-textual materials;</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>seeks to promote discoverability and accessibility, enrich useful Library spaces, protect physical materials, and provide scholars with thoughtfully curated collections.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<h2><span><span><span>Determining factors for including materials in the digital collections workflow:</span></span></span></h2>

<h2><span><span><span>The Digital Collections Strategy specifically excludes:</span></span></span></h2>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>non-unique materials for curricular support, and</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>materials which violate privacy laws or policies</span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<h2><span><span><span>Decommissioning Digital Collections:</span></span></span></h2>

<p><span><span><span>The Library carefully acquires, evaluates, manages, and preserves its digital materials. However, there are circumstances that call for tough decisions regarding the decommissioning of materials, such as:</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>recognizing the lifecycle of resources and information and removing materials which are no longer usable or useful to University programs</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>responding to copyright disputes</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>protecting privacy</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>preservation challenges, e.g. technical resources to repair something which cannot be fixed or has long-term renderability issues</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
