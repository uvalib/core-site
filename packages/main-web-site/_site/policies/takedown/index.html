<p>As our <a href="/policies/collection-development-and-management/">Collection Development and Management</a> policy explains, in general, the Library does not discard its resources. However, if you would like to file a takedown request pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 1201) for an item hosted by the Library (e.g., in <a href="/libra/">Libra</a>), please visit the University’s <a href="https://security.virginia.edu/copyrights-digital-materials-and-software-procedures">DMCA policy page</a> and follow the instructions there. Other questions or concerns about materials in our collections can be sent to <a href="mailto:collections-inquiry@virginia.edu">collections-inquiry@virginia.edu</a>. In your inquiry, please clearly specify:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Your full name and contact information.</li>
	<li>The exact item or items you are inquiring about—providing a URL that links directly to the item or its Virgo record is ideal.</li>
	<li>The nature of your question or concern.</li>
</ol>
