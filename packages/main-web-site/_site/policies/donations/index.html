<h2>Important: Gifts Moratorium</h2>

<p><em>Effective September 1, 2019.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>This moratorium suspends gift acceptance activities beginning September 1, 2019 until&nbsp;<strong>at least&nbsp;</strong>August 1, 2021 for the circulating collection. Please note that this proposal does not apply to the current gift acceptance practices for The <span>Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library</span>.<span>&nbsp;</span>During the moratorium no gifts for the circulating collection will be accepted or stored by the University Libraries.</p>

<p>The current collection relocation project for Alderman Renewal has made clear that the library has limited space for storing and processing collections during the library renovation project. This moratorium will help technical services and collections personnel prioritize current gift collections that are already in process and determine appropriate measures.</p>

<p><span>In order to provide a service to potential donors, the Library has worked with several other Virginia educational institutions to create a&nbsp;</span><a href="http://guides.lib.virginia.edu/GiftReferrals"><span>referral list</span></a><span>&nbsp;for donations&nbsp;that may be made directly to another institution in the Commonwealth.</span></p>
