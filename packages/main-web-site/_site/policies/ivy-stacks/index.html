<p>The Ivy Stacks Reading Room is available by appointment to view large sets of materials not feasible to be transported to a library location On-Grounds.</p>

<p>Appointments must be made <strong>5 business days* in advance</strong> of a visit, and are available Monday-Friday between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.</p>

<p>*As the Ivy facility settles into normalcy after the relocation of Alderman materials, we may be able to lessen the 5 day wait. This policy will be revisited in summer 2020 and this page will be updated as appropriate.</p>
