<p>The following Library electronic database policy applies to all University of Virginia libraries with the exception of the Graduate Business, Health Sciences, and Law libraries.</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>

<h3>Primary Users</h3>

<p>University of Virginia faculty, graduate and undergraduate students, and staff.</p>

<h2>Policy</h2>

<p>Electronic databases for which the Library pays a fee to vendors are restricted to our primary users. The databases have various licensing constraints; some are explicitly restricted to our primary users. Electronic access is not permitted to other users from outside of the University of Virginia Library. Non-UVA researchers are able to access online resources from within UVA library buildings. For specific questions please consult with reference staff.</p>

<p>Data created in the Library, e.g., electronic texts, image files, geographic and numerical data, and multi-media, is made available to all users as copyright and licensing permit. Much of this value-added information has copyright restrictions and licensing constraints that restrict use to the primary users of the University Library.</p>

<p>The Library provides circulation of physical materials to all users, as identified in the <a href="/policies/circulation/">Library's circulation policy</a>, accessible in all library locations and on the Web.</p>
