<p>This policy governs the collection development and acquisition of data at UVA Library.&nbsp;All acquisitions initiated by the Library will follow these guidelines.</p>

<p><strong>Demand:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>There should be broad curricular and research interest in the data to be acquired. In order to maximize impact, we strive to build a data collection useful to the largest number of people, and preference will be given to data requests that meet that requirement.</li>
	<li>Access should not be restricted by school or department if purchased by UVA Library.</li>
	<li>“Single user” datasets will not be purchased (e.g., iTunes model). That is, if only a single user (or project team) can use the dataset based on restrictive license terms or technical requirements, we cannot purchase the data.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cost:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Joint purchases between the Library, researchers, and/or departments, are encouraged.</li>
	<li>Typically the library can allocate $5,000 for a research data acquisition of value to a range of research interests, and $1,000 for research data of value to a single researcher. These amounts are flexible, and we encourage researchers to consider the value of the data to the widest number of UVA affiliates.</li>
	<li>At the same time, we strive to be flexible; an expensive dataset or database that has high value – broad impact across research and instruction at UVA – will be considered. Supplemental funding on the part of the researcher or schools are especially welcome in these cases.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Scope:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Numeric, spatial, and textual data will all be considered.</li>
	<li>To be included in our collections, data can be purchased, licensed, or open.
	<ul>
		<li>Purchased data are data that the Library owns outright (although there may be terms of use in a contract).</li>
		<li>Licensed data are data that the Library essentially rents for a period of time, which may be predetermined or on-going.</li>
		<li>Open data are data that are openly available to the public.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Data should be relevant to research and curricular needs of UVA.</li>
	<li>Any time period, geography, or language will be considered.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Quality:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Data are current, and do not require frequent or costly updates.</li>
	<li>Data are from a credible and reliable source.</li>
	<li>The vendor is a reliable business partner.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Format and Access:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Supported access methods:
	<ul>
		<li>Mounted on Library server with IP-access (e.g., Dave Leip Election Data)</li>
		<li>Mounted on Library server with dedicated terminal access (e.g., Geolytics Census CDs)</li>
		<li>Online licensed databases with IP-access (e.g., Social Explorer)</li>
		<li>Online data repositories with institutional memberships (e.g., ICPSR)</li>
		<li>Online licensed databases with dedicated terminal access (e.g., Datastream)</li>
		<li>Physical format (e.g., CD-ROM)</li>
		<li>Freely available online resources</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Preference is given to data that can be stored online and remotely accessed.</li>
	<li>Preference is given to software-independent (“standard”) formats. If not software independent, the interface must offer ease of use.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Documentation:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Data must be accompanied by adequate documentation and metadata.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Decision Making Authority:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Acquisition decisions will include the Data Librarian, the relevant Liaison Librarian(s), and Collections Management within the Library.</li>
</ul>
