<p> When materials are returned late and fines have accrued, the user will receive notification of the amount and reason for the fines.  When materials are not returned and become long overdue, the user is billed for replacement cost and library privileges are suspended.  This includes use of Special Collections, Interlibrary Services and LEO book delivery.  Payment for materials found and returned within 90 days of payment will be refunded. </p>

<p> Student fines will be referred to the University Student Financial Services for collection as part of the universityâ€™s centralized billing system.  Other users may clear their accounts at any Library circulation unit by returning the items.  However, all fines incurred by non-students must be paid at Alderman Library. </p>
