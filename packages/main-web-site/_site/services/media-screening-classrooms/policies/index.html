<p>We’re happy to offer media classrooms in support of UVA’s teaching, learning, and research activities. To ensure a pleasant and productive environment for everyone, we ask that you please recognize and agree to our policies when booking and using rooms:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Priority is given to those with teaching, learning, and research needs.</li>
	<li>Rooms are offered on a first-come, first-served basis.</li>
	<li>You may not rewire or unplug the audio or video equipment, or change the settings on the ceiling mounted digital projectors.</li>
	<li>First-time users, or those who haven’t used the room in more than a year, should contact our A/V technician, <a href="mailto:rah6w@virginia.edu">Ric Hodges</a> (434-243-5597), prior to your session to learn how to use the equipment.</li>
	<li>Faculty and teaching graduate students who wish to book rooms for a full semester may do so only when the technology requirements of a class cannot be filled through the Registrar, and with the advance permission of the <a href="http://www.virginia.edu/registrar/contact.html">University Registrar</a> and in coordinate with the Library. For more information, contact <a href="mailto:libevents@virginia.edu">libevents@virginia.edu</a>.</li>
	<li>The G-Lab cannot be reserved for full semester classes. Occasional classes must be reserved in accordance with&nbsp;the University schedule for that day.</li>
	<li>If a faculty member reserves a room for a class session but is unable to be there personally, he or she must assign a ‘student designate’ who will responsibly operate the equipment, oversee the class, and receive equipment training by contacting <a href="mailto:rah6w@virginia.edu">Ric Hodges</a> (434-243-5597).</li>
	<li>With the exception of the G-Lab, food and drink are welcome, but you must dispose of trash properly and leave the room in clean condition.</li>
	<li>Furniture must be returned to its original state after your session.</li>
</ul>

<p>By booking a room, you agree to these policies and to being responsible for the room and its equipment.</p>
