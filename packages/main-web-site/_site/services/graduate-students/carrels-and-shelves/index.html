<h2 id="fineArts">Fine Arts Library Study Carrel Policies</h2>

<p>To apply for a Fine Arts Library study carrel, visit the Fine Arts Library circulation desk.</p>

<p>The Fine Arts Library offers carrels to graduate students in Art History, Architectural History, Architectural Design, Planning, and Drama.</p>

<p>Assignments are made for one academic year, beginning <strong>August 15</strong>. Carrels are assigned in the order in which your application is received. Carrel holders last year have first preference.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Due to space limitations, more than one person may be assigned to each carrel.</p>

<h3>Carrel Policies</h3>

<ul>
	<li><strong>All books kept in carrels must be checked out to you and have carrel slips in them or they will be removed from the carrel. </strong></li>
	<li>Do not store more books in your carrel than it will reasonably hold without damaging the books.</li>
	<li>Items sustaining damage from abuse or overcrowding will be removed and your carrel privileges revoked.</li>
	<li>Folios, reference, and other non-circulating items may not be stored in carrels.</li>
	<li>Electrical outlets are available in carrels 1-26 (some lettered carrels are near pillars on which there are outlets and most lettered carrels can reach an outlet with an extension cord).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Shelving Policies</h3>

<p>There are a limited number of shelves to be assigned to graduate students for the books they wish to keep at the Fine Arts Library. They will be assigned as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>One shelf to one graduate student.</li>
	<li>The number of books on the shelf will neatly line up to fill the shelf. No stacking will be allowed; any books not fitting on the shelf should be taken home.</li>
	<li>Each book on the shelf must have a carrel slip and be checked out to the user of the shelf.</li>
	<li>The shelf must be maintained neatly and must not hold anything that might spill onto the shelves below.</li>
</ul>
