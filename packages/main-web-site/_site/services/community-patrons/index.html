<h2>Using Library Spaces and Materials</h2>

<h3>Things to know about visiting our library spaces</h3>

<p><strong>Visitors are welcome to Library buildings for research and study during regular <a href="/hours/">operating hours</a>.</strong> Different libraries hold different kinds of collections, and all have places to read and study.</p>

<p>Some library buildings have restrictions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Access to Alderman, Clemons, Brown, and Fine Arts libraries are restricted to current UVA students/faculty/staff after 10:00pm on the days they close after 10:00pm (varies by library). <strong><a href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/hours">See all Library hours.&nbsp;</a></strong></li>
	<li>The Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library is open to the public.</li>
	<li>Researchers not affiliated with UVA have access to the collections upon filling out a brief form and showing a photo ID issued by a government agency or employer.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reference Services &amp; Using Materials</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Reference assistance is available in Library buildings.</li>
	<li>Virginia residents 16 years of age and older, and registered researchers, can check out books using their Virginia driver's license or other photo ID. If there are materials you want but we do not have, visit your local public library—they may have them or be able to request them through their interlibrary loan system.</li>
	<li>Community patrons must <a href="https://uva.hosts.atlas-sys.com/illiadauth">register for an&nbsp;ILLIAD account</a> to be able to request items from off-site storage (anything labeled "Request from Ivy" or "By-Request" in Virgo).</li>
	<li>Community patrons may check out CDs and other sound recordings from the Music Library for a week.</li>
	<li>Community patrons may check out two DVDs or other videos at a time from Clemons Library for a week with one renewal. </li>
	<li>UVA Library, as a <a href="http://guides.lib.virginia.edu/regional">federal depository library</a>, makes government information in all formats available for use by anyone. The <a href="/policies/use-of-the-library/">Library use policy</a> applies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Access to Research Databases</h2>

<p><strong>The research databases the Library subscribes to are available from public computer terminals in Alderman, Charles L. Brown Science &amp; Engineering Library, and Clemons.</strong><strong> </strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Please be aware that the number of computers is limited and priority is given to students doing research.</li>
	<li>If a computer is available, Desk Staff will ask to see a photo ID, then can log you in. </li>
	<li>You are encouraged to bring your own laptop or computing device.</li>
	<li>The free wireless network (UVA GUEST) is available at all UVA Libraries. </li>
	<li>All patrons are expected to abide by our <a href="/policies/use-of-the-library/">library use policy</a>&nbsp;and <a href="/policies/access-to-databases/">database access policy</a>.</li>
