<p>The University Library provides a variety of scanning services for faculty who would like text, images, or audio-visual materials to be digitized for classroom or research use. For non-UVA affiliated researchers, there is a fee-based scanning service for the digitization of archival materials housed in the <a href="/libraries/#special-collections">Small Special Collections Library</a>.</p>

<h3 id="video-mats">Digitization of Video Clips</h3>

<p>The <a href="/libraries/#robertson-media-center">Robertson Media Center</a> will digitize video clips for faculty to use in teaching and research. Clips save time by isolating portions of videos to show in class, release faculty from the need to fast forward or watch previews, provide a consistent viewing experience, and allow collection of related material in one location. Clips will be made available&nbsp;via USB drive or uploaded to Collab.</p>

<p>NOTE: Clips are made available for internal teaching, research, and educational uses only and not for external distribution. The service is not for entire videos but only for short scenes or collections of scenes. Video clip requests will typically require a week to process, longer if the video needs to be purchased first.</p>

<h4>Request Process</h4>

<p>To make a clip request, fill out&nbsp;the <a href="/services/video-clip-service">online form</a>. We will need:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The version of the video from which you want the clips (if we don’t own a copy of the version you are using, we will need to purchase it for the Library or use your personal copy).</li>
	<li>The start and end times for each clip requested.</li>
	<li>A brief description of the content being clipped, especially at the start and end points.</li>
</ul>

<p>Users are notified via e-mail when the clips have been digitized. If you have additional questions, feel free to contact <a href="mailto:rmc-res@virginia.edu">rmc-res@virginia.edu</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://guides.lib.virginia.edu/c.php?g=514918&amp;p=3520108">Other questions about digitizing video for instructional use</a> should be directed to the <a href="http://guides.lib.virginia.edu/videos">Media Collections Librarian</a>.</p>
