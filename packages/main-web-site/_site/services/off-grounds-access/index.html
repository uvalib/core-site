    <p>The Libraries provide three types of web resources:</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>E-books, images and other databases created by the Libraries. These are either out of copyright or were created at the University and are generally freely available to all.</li>
    	<li>E-books, e-journals, and other databases provided via open access.&nbsp; These are generally provided by a publisher or government agency and are freely available to all.</li>
    	<li>E-books, e-journals, images and other databases that are covered by copyright. The Libraries license their use for the University and the contracts generally restrict use to students, faculty and staff of the University. See <a href="/policies/access-to-databases/">access policy information</a> if you're not sure about your user status.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These licensed databases can normally be used only from computers on Grounds, but there are workarounds to allow use from home or while traveling.</p>

          <p>ITS maintains a proxy server (EZproxy) that provides access to selected web resources, including all UVA Library databases. You simply logon via the NetBadge prompt when attempting to access a database that you would link to from the Library’s website.</p>
          <p>EZProxy can provide good access to licensed web resources. It simply requires a NetBadge login, and will also work on any platform/browser, including mobile devices.</p>

        <div class="card-content">
          <p>ITS provides a "virtual private network" that puts your computer temporarily on the UVA network. You’ll need to register with ITS to put a certificate on your computer, and then download and install the network software.</p>
          <p>UVA Anywhere is available for Windows, Linux, and Macintosh computers. Once configured, UVA Anywhere provides reliable, fast access not only to Library databases, but also to non-web resources such as EndNote and Home Directory. Setup is more complicated than for proxy and requires downloading software. There can be problems with software firewalls and with some Internet service providers, including AOL.</p>

        <div class="card-content">
          <p>UVA Anywhere-Lite WebVPN enables UVA students and employees to access restricted resources such as online library journals and software downloads from off-Grounds using just a web browser. These resources would normally be accessible <em>only</em> if your computer is physically located on Grounds and connected to the University network.</p>
          <p>UVA Anywhere-Lite is <em>not</em> a full replacement for the standard UVA Anywhere VPN, which protects <em>all</em> network traffic, whether or not it’s web-based, between your machine and the UVA network. Install and use the full UVA Anywhere service where possible, and use UVA Anywhere-Lite when you need access only to access web-based resources.</p>
