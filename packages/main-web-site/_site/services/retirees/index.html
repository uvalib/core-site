<h3>In addition to our general library use&nbsp;<a href="/policies/">policies</a>&nbsp;and privileges, UVA retirees are entitled to some additional Library access.</h3>

<h2>Book Check out</h2>

<p>Simply notify us that you would like to retain your check out privileges. We will make notes in our system to ensure that your VIRGO patron ID remains valid. Contact us via email at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:lib-circ@virginia.edu">lib-circ@virginia.edu</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="mailto:library@virginia.edu">library@virginia.edu</a>, or call us at 434-924-3021.</p>

<h2>Database Access</h2>

<p><strong>Anyone coming into our libraries has access to almost all of our online resources.</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>To retain off-Grounds access to UVA&nbsp;<a href="https://guides.lib.virginia.edu/az.php?">subscription databases</a>, full text journal articles, and streaming videos you must retain your UVA email address and&nbsp;<strong>renew it annually</strong>. This controls your Netbadge and Eservices credentials as well as your email access. UVA ITS administers this access. Contact them at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:accounts-access@virginia.edu">accounts-access@virginia.edu</a>&nbsp;or 434-924-0817 with any questions or to request reactivation of your UVA email.</li>
	<li>Health System retirees should be aware that they will not be able to retain their UVA email addresses, but can contact Accounts to retain Netbadge and Eservices access.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Interlibrary Loan (ILL)</h2>

<p>All retirees wishing to ILL materials should maintain credentials with ITS.&nbsp; (See Database Access above)</p>

<p>Retired faculty can continue to request books through ILL. These will be delivered to their department or individual office if applicable.</p>

<p>Other UVA retirees</p>

<ul>
	<li>Three active requests at a time. As soon as an item is returned and checked in or an email notification about a PDF scan request has been sent, the user will be able to place another request.</li>
	<li>If an ILL is placed for an item UVA owns but is checked out, we will ILL it if it available from a reciprocal lender, but recall it if it is not.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Events</h2>

<p>All UVA retirees are welcome at Library events that are open to the public. This includes lectures, classes, exhibit openings, and the like. Please come!</p>

<h2>Computer use</h2>

<p><strong>Public computers are available within most UVA libraries</strong>.</p>

<ul>
	<li>A picture ID is required to log on, and access may be limited at certain times of the semester, as&nbsp;<strong>UVA students, faculty, and staff have to be our top priority</strong>.</li>
	<li>If you have a laptop, you can get a wireless PIN by presenting a picture ID at Alderman, Brown, and Clemons.</li>
</ul>
