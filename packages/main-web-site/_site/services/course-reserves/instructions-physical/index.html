<p>Reserve requests are processed in the order in which they are received. Please allow 14 days to process requests. If the library needs to recall or purchase the material, requests may take longer to fill. Although we make every effort to process requests quickly, we cannot guarantee timely service for last-minute requests. You will receive an e-mail confirmation when your reserve request has been received. Reserve requests are made by selecting items from Virgo.</p>
