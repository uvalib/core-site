<p><span lang="EN-US"><span>The reserves service at the University of Virginia Library provides access to essential curriculum materials that are supplementary to the required texts. </span></span></p>

<h2>Books</h2>

<p>Books that are required to be read in their entirety for courses should be listed as required textbooks and ordered through the University Bookstore. </p>

<p>For course reserves, the Library can scan a limited amount of a physical book to be added to your course site (Collab, Canvas, etc). In some cases, the Library may respond to a request by providing a link to an electronic book or other online copy of the requested text. </p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Please allow as much time as possible to process requests. </strong>The library anticipates a large number of scanning requests and may need multiple weeks to process course reserves under current conditions.</li>
	<li>Processing may be delayed if books are currently checked out or need to be quarantined.</li>
	<li>Although we make every effort to process requests quickly, we cannot guarantee timely service for last-minute requests.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Reserve requests are processed in the order in which they are received.</li>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>How does Copyright apply to Course Reserves?&nbsp;</h3>

<p>All classroom materials are provided to students within a password-protected course environment for research and classroom instruction only. Copyright law forbids redistribution of scanned course materials unless permission from the copyright holder has been obtained, the work is out of copyright, or a careful fair use analysis has been undertaken. Faculty members are personally responsible under University policy for respecting copyright, including their delivery of materials to students through course reserves.</p>

<p><a href="http://copyright.library.virginia.edu/classroom-scanning/">Read full Copyright guidelines for classroom scanning</a></p>

<h3>How many items can I put on Reserve?</h3>

<p>While there are not space limitations for e-reserves, please only place items that are essential for your course on Reserve. For books, please be sure to select only the pages which are needed for your course. This is particularly important for items which need to be scanned.</p>

<h3>What about textbooks? </h3>

<p>While it is <a href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/policies/textbook-acquisition-policy/">general policy</a> of the Library not to purchase copies of textbooks, exceptions to this policy will be considered on an individual basis by the appropriate subject librarian. It is important to note that most major textbook publishers won’t sell a textbook to a library, and that most electronic versions of textbooks allow only one user (and therefore aren’t suitable for library collections). If the Library already owns a textbook, we can scan a portion for electronic Reserve. You may also bring us a personal copy (see Personal Copies above).</p>

<h3>What if I need something scanned for Reserve right away? </h3>

<p>Although we make every effort to process requests quickly, we cannot guarantee timely service for last-minute requests.   </p>

<h3>What if something I need is checked out? </h3>

<p>Items that are checked out will be recalled. Please note that recalled items may take 3 weeks or longer to process. In addition, keep in mind that some recalled items may not be returnable under the current circumstances. It may take additional time to provide alternative access. </p>

<h3>How about items that the Library doesn’t have? </h3>

<p>Please <a href="/services/course-reserves/personal/">make a Purchase Recommendation</a> (note textbook exception above).</p>

<h3>Where can my students find my course reserves?</h3>

<p>Links to ebooks and scans of articles or chapters/portions of books will be sent to instructors via email. Instructors should load readings to Collab, Canvas, or other private course sites for students to access. Streaming video reserves will be delivered to course Collab or Canvas sites.</p>
