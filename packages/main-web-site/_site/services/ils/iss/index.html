<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>We provide assistance to instructors by scanning course related materials for inclusion as additional readings. ISS also provides articles and book excerpts from electronic databases and e-books available through the library catalog (VIRGO).</p>

<p>The services of Instructional Scanning are intended to support learning, teaching, research, and scholarship and are offered only to University of Virginia graduate instructors, faculty, and staff. Interlibrary loans involve expenditure of state and university funds. The Library reserves the right to review patron requests for ILL services and to decline such requests at the Library’s sole discretion. As is the case with all other Library services, patrons are expected to comply with copyright in their use of materials obtained through Interlibrary Loan.</p>
