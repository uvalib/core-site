<p><a href="#request-process">Jump to &quot;Request Process&quot; above to see how to set up departmental delivery. </a></p>
<p>Not seeing your department? Graduate students also have the option of getting materials delivered to any <a href="https://library.virginia.edu/libraries">Library location</a>. <a href="#request-process"></a></p>
<p>When an item is delivered to a department, no notification is sent to alert the requester. Items delivered to Library locations will receive a notification.</p>
<p>The choice to have a book delivered to a department means that that item will be checked out upon delivery, and the responsibility for the safety of that item with the user from that point on. This is the implied consent given by use of this service. Users can always choose any library location to hold their items for pickup if they do not wish to consent.</p>
<h3>Limitations</h3>
<p><strong>Graduate students may have 25 active requests.</strong> As soon as a Scan request has been saved on the server for you to access, OR, an ILL or UVA item has been checked out to you, it no longer counts toward your active request count. </p>
<p><strong>Certain types of materials cannot be delivered via LEO. </strong>These materials include items like those made "in-library use only" by lending libraries, items from the Reference collection, DVDs, and microfiche.
