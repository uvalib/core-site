<p>An&nbsp;<a href="https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/categories/360000663034">ORCID iD</a> is a unique researcher identifier, used worldwide, that you can keep throughout your life and retain even if you move institutions. Short for Open Researcher and Contributor Identifier, it distinguishes you from other researchers, even if they have the same name, and enables authoritative links to be created between you and your research activities.</p>

<h3>Manage Your ORCID</h3>
