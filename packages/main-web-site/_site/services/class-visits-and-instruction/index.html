<p>We are delighted to provide UVA classes with instructional sessions using the wealth of materials in our Special Collections Library. In order to allow adequate preparation, <strong>we require that sessions and materials requests be made at least two weeks ahead of time. </strong></p>

<p>We are conducting both in-person and remote Special Collections sessions during the Spring 2021 semester.</p>

<p><strong>In light of COVID-19â€™s social distancing requirements, a few restrictions are in place: </strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Sessions are limited to classes with a student <strong>enrollment of 20 or fewer</strong>.</li>
	<li>In-person sessions will be scheduled <strong>based on the pedagogical</strong> need to access physical materials, as well as on staff and room availability.</li>
	<li>Materials handling will be restricted to Special Collections staff unless an exception is granted for faculty handling</li>
</ul>

<p>We are happy to work with you to create an online session (synchronous or asynchronous) for the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>General introductions to Special Collections.</li>
	<li>Classes with more than 20 students.</li>
	<li>Online classes of any size.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note: Our operational status is dependent on that of the University. If the decision is made to move classes online, we may need to adjust our services.</p>
