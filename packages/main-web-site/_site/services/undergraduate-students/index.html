        	<p>Professors often ask the Library to set aside books for students to use for short periods rather than asking each student to buy the text. These <a href="https://ils.lib.virginia.edu/uhtbin/cgisirsi/x/0/X/36/1252/X?user_id=WEBSERVER">“reserves” can be searched in Virgo.</a></p>

        <h3>Articles and Databases</h3>
        	<p>What is an <strong>academic article</strong>, and why do your professors want you to use them? Academic articles are articles written by researchers (often, but not always, professors) to contribute to general knowledge. They are usually published in <strong>journals</strong>, which are like magazines for researchers.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Journals, like magazines, will have a topic focus. That focus can be anything, from civil engineering to African literature to medical sociology to media studies. The most popular and respected journals tend to be <strong>peer-reviewed</strong>, that is, other professors working in a subject area will read and give feedback on an article draft before the journal will publish it.</p>

			<p>Journals have traditionally been published in print, but more and more students and scholars now use the online/electronic versions of journals to find articles.</p>

			<p><strong>Academic databases</strong> collect these articles into one spot for ease of searching. There are dedicated databases for all kinds of subjects and also general databases that multiple subjects. Universities subscribe to databases to help their students and faculty do research.</p>

        		<p><img alt="find at UVA" data-align="right" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="923b566e-7eea-4d90-a80a-038d71e8c339" src="/sites/default/files/inline-images/finduva.png" />When searching UVA databases and looking for articles, be on the lookout for the FIND AT UVA button. This button will help you find an article’s full text by looking through all of UVA’s databases at once.</p>
        </li>
		  
		  
        <li>
        <h3>Subject Guides</h3>
        	<p>Subject guides are websites made by librarians that gather together all of the resources that UVA offers to relating to a particular subject. These guides can be very helpful for finding the right database to search, collections of newspapers or other primary sources, resources on a discipline’s methods, or the right style guidelines for your bibliography. </p>

        <h3>Interlibrary Loan</h3>
        	<p>What if a book you want is checked out, or if we don’t have access to an article that would be perfect for your paper? Never fear! <a href="/services/ils/ill/">Use Interlibrary Loan</a> to request that the book be sent to you from another university or to request a PDF scan of an article. Click the “Sign In” button on the right column to sign in or sign up for a free ILL account. <strong>Never pay to get an academic article—we will be able to find it for you through ILL.</strong></p>

        <h3>Virtual Shelf Browse</h3>
        	<p>Browsing the shelves is a great way to find books on a particular topic in the same place, because libraries are organized by subject. But you don’t need to go to the stacks to take advantage of this! Use Virgo's Virtual Shelf Browse feature to see all the library’s holdings around a given book’s <strong>call number</strong>. (Every item in the library has a unique call number, which acts like the book's address on the library's shelves or stacks.)</p>
