<p>Course Enrichment Grants, offered by the University of Virginia Library, provide support to faculty who would like to enhance students’ abilities to seek, evaluate, manage, and use information and data in scholarly contexts, as well as create new types of media-rich class assignments.</p>

<p>Faculty recipients of these grants will be awarded:</p>

<ul>
	<li>$2,500, which can be applied to summer wages or to a research account.</li>
	<li>Dedicated support from experienced librarians, technologists, or other library staff.</li>
</ul>

<p>The program is intended to fund projects that promote student learning in the areas described below. All funded projects will involve partnership with a team of library staff with expertise in the proposed topic.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Enhance students’ ability to critically find, evaluate, interrogate, manage, and use information both within and beyond their field of study.</li>
	<li>Help students to conduct archival research, gaining competencies in finding, using, and interpreting archival and primary source material.</li>
	<li>Strengthen students’ ability to discover,&nbsp; ethically use/reuse, collect, manage, store, and share data from a wide variety of sources.</li>
	<li>Allow students to explore new technologies, such as video, audio, 3D, immersive, and maker-related projects, and produce course assignments in a variety of media.</li>

	<li>Support faculty who wish to use open educational resources and practices in their courses.</li>
</ul>

<p>Applications are welcome from all disciplines. This year, we especially encourage applications that explore the use of open educational resources as a means of practicing inclusive or active pedagogy.</p>

<p>Proposals should be for courses in which planning can be completed in anticipation of the course offering.&nbsp;That means for fall 2021 courses, planning should be undertaken in the summer 2021; and for J-Term 2022, spring 2022, and summer 2022 courses, planning should be completed before the start of the target semester.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
