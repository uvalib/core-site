<p>Research Sprints, hosted by the University of Virginia Library, offer faculty the opportunity to partner with a team of expert librarians on a specific project or component of a broader project. Sprints differ from one-time consultations in their timing and depth of interaction. Individuals or teams of faculty will work intensively with librarians for four and a half working days. The intention is for the entire team — faculty and library staff — to work without distractions for that period of time to produce a tangible product or outcome.</p>

<p>The program supports projects at any phase of the scholarly lifecycle, providing&nbsp;an excellent opportunity for faculty who want to get started on a new project or overcome an obstacle on an existing project.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, startup projects might benefit from literature reviews or facilitated brainstorming, or from the design of a roadmap toward the application of technology to a research or a teaching problem; in-progress projects might require help on information or data organization or curation.&nbsp; Projects nearing completion might benefit by assistance in managing scholarly communications or designing programs, or identifying and evaluating intellectual property or copyright issues.&nbsp; We welcome proposals for projects that are exploratory and experimental, as well as those that are well advanced.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Potential project areas include, but are not limited to, the following areas in which we have in-house expertise:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Archival research</li>
	<li>Data and metadata creation, management, analysis, and preservation</li>
	<li>Literature reviews</li>
	<li>Intellectual property/copyright</li>
	<li>Application of technology to a research or teaching problem</li>
	<li>Grant proposals</li>

	<li>Open educational resource adoption or creation (open textbooks, teaching videos, etc.)</li>
	<li>Pedagogy and instructional design (course assignment redesign, creation of learning objects, etc.)</li>
	<li>Preservation of scholarly work</li>
	<li>Publication proposal or journal creation</li>
</ul>
