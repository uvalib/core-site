<h3 id="when-to">When to Caption: General Guidelines</h3>

<p><span><span>Transcription and/or captioning is <em>required</em> for live and recorded events (including classes), when the event is made available to public, there is no registration process, or when an accommodation is being provided for an employee or student. Beyond these cases, there are many situations where captioning or transcripts are <em>beneficial</em>. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Automatic Speech Recognition technology is an option, but there are considerations to keep in mind and occasions where it may not be an appropriate solution. </span></span></p>

<h3 id="captioning">Captioning &amp; Transcription Guidelines</h3>

<p>According to the <a href="http://www.captioningkey.org/quality_captioning.html#1">Described and Captioned Media Program Captioning Key</a>, quality captions and transcripts are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Accurate</strong>: Errorless captions are the goal for each production.</li>
	<li><strong>Consistent</strong>: Uniformity in style and presentation of all captioning features is crucial for viewer understanding.</li>
	<li><strong>Clear</strong>: A complete textual representation of the audio, including speaker identification and non-speech information, provides clarity.</li>
	<li><strong>Readable</strong>: Captions are displayed with enough time to be read completely, are in synchronization with the audio, and are not obscured by (nor do they obscure) the visual content.</li>
	<li><strong>Equal</strong>: Equal access requires that the meaning and intention of the material is completely preserved.</li>
</ul>

<p>Best practices by peer institutions:</p>

<h3 id="transcript-only">Is Providing Only A Transcript Enough?</h3>

<p>In short, only when the transcript provides access to audio-only material.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.3playmedia.com/2016/03/02/americans-with-disabilities-act-ada-and-web-accessibility-requirements-for-video/"><strong>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</strong></a>&nbsp;requires that an&nbsp;<strong>equivalent experience</strong>&nbsp;must be provided for individuals who are&nbsp;Deaf and/or Hard of Hearing (D/HoH). Transcription is not time-coded, therefore it does not allow D/HoH viewers to follow along in real-time with the content. Unless the media is audio-only (such as radio programs or podcasts), transcripts alone will not be enough; you must use captions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;That said, transcripts can be useful in some contexts. For example:</p>

<ul>
	<li>a helpful first step in the&nbsp;DIY process for captioning recorded video</li>
	<li>helpful for English language learners</li>
	<li>transcripts are simple to translate into other languages for global accessibility</li>
	<li>helpful for individuals with other disabilities</li>
	<li>provides better search engine optimization (SEO) of video and audio content</li>
	<li>the best way to make radio programs or Podcasts accessible</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="process">Captioning Processes</h2>

<h4 id="post-production">Post-Production Captioning</h4>

<p>Post-production captions are created after the live event has occurred. The recording should not be made available until the captions have been created and checked for accuracy and adherence to best practices.</p>

<p>To assure an equal experience for individuals who are Deaf and/or Hard of Hearing (D/HoH), our goal is 100% accuracy for post-production closed or open captions – including sound effects, speaker identification and other information to maintain context.</p>

<p><a href="/services/accessibility-services/media-accessibility-resources/post-production">Find out more about Post-Production Captioning &gt;&nbsp;</a></p>

<h4 id="live">Live Captioning, CART, Live Streaming</h4>

<p>Live captioning should be considered when hosting online meetings, webinars, online classes and other training events, and when streaming live events. It should also be strongly considered when hosting live events onsite. Adding live captions to the live event provides greater access and interaction for many members of the audience, not just those who are D/HoH.</p>

<p>Individuals who are D/HoH may use a variety of options for communication access to an event. The best option will depend on the preference of the individual and the type of event.</p>

<p>NOTE: If you are considering live captioning/streaming for a student’s accommodation need, or if a request for American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation has been received, contact the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.studenthealth.virginia.edu/sdac">Student Disability Access Center</a>&nbsp;before proceeding.</p>

<h3 id="methods">Methods for Creating Transcripts and Captions</h3>

<p>There are three basic methods for creating captions for both post-production and live events: Hiring a vendor, do-it-yourself (DIY), and Automatic Speech Recognition.</p>

<h4>Hiring a Vendor</h4>

<p>UVA has access to contracts with three vendors who provide professional-quality services.&nbsp;<a href="/services/accessibility-services/media-accessibility-resources/approved-captioning-and-transcription-vendors/">Read more about hiring a vendor.</a></p>

<h4>Do-It-Yourself Captions</h4>

<p>Captioning video is not technically difficult; however, it is very time consuming. You need to assess the value of your time or the time of your employees. When you consider the per hour rate, the cost of manually creating captions can be substantial.&nbsp;<a href="/services/accessibility-services/media-accessibility-resources/do-it-yourself-captioning/">See more Do-It-Yourself options.</a></p>

<h4>Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)</h4>

<p>While technology is advancing rapidly in this area, captions created by using ASR, such as those provided by Google for YouTube videos, are not accurate enough to be adequate.</p>

<h2 id="audio-description">Audio Description</h2>

<p>Audio Description, also called descriptive video or video description, is a secondary audio track (either recorded by a person or created by running text-to-speech software on a timed text file) that describes and gives context for essential visual information. Audio Description makes videos and multimedia accessible to people who have low vision or who are blind, by capturing what is happening on screen into audible descriptions that are played during natural pauses in the audio track.</p>

	<li><a href="https://webaccess.berkeley.edu/resources/tips/audio-description">Web Access: About Audio Description (UC Berkeley)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Creating audio descriptions is an art. Some of our vendors offer audio description services, however, this is new technology the resulting descriptions need to be reviewed for quality and accuracy.</p>

<h2 id="media-players">Accessible Media Players</h2>

<p>An accessible media player supports captions, audio description, keyboard-only controls, and other accessibility features.</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/ableplayer">Able Player</a>&nbsp;is a fully accessible cross-browser HTML5 media player. Created by Terrill Thompson of the Univ of Washington and&nbsp;<a href="https://ableplayer.github.io/ableplayer/">available through GitHub</a>, it is offered for free and is in use by several of our peer institutions.</li>

	<li><a href="https://www.accessibilityoz.com/ozplayer/">OzPlayer (AccessibilityOz)</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="copyright">Copyright Considerations</h2>

<p>It is important that you consider the copyright of the material you are planning to use. If you do not own the material, it is important that you attempt the following before you proceed with captioning:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Try to find a captioned version first</li>
	<li>Ask the owner for permission to caption</li>
</ul>

<p>It is also important that seeking copyright permission not delay the production of accessible materials. For more information, please refer to “<a href="https://www.arl.org/resources/the-law-and-accessible-texts-reconciling-civil-rights-and-copyrights/">The Law and Accessible Text: Reconciling Civil Rights and Copyrights</a>”.</p>

<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>

<p><strong>Audio description</strong>&nbsp;– Enables individuals who are blind or have low vision to hear a spoken narration of a video or movie’s key visual elements, including, but not limited to, the action, settings, facial expressions, costumes, and scene changes.</p>

<p><strong>Captions</strong>&nbsp;– <em>Post-production captions</em> are a time synchronized, verbatim transcript file that accurately matches the audio in a recorded video and paired with the video file through a media player. Captions not only include the spoken word, but relevant sound effects and other audio components that convey the full context of the video. &nbsp;<em>Captions during a live event</em> are provided when a captionist/transcriber listens to a live event and simultaneously translates all speech to text for display.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Closed captions</strong>&nbsp;– Captions that are able to be turned on or off by the viewer within the media player. For recorded material, a separate file (a sidecar file) with the captions is paired with the video file to create the captioned product.</li>
	<li><strong>Open captions</strong>&nbsp;– Captions that are “burned into” the video. These are always present in the video and cannot be turned off.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>CART – </strong>Communication Access Realtime Translation. This is a service where a captionist/transcriber listens to a live event and simultaneously translates all speech to text for display. Display options include computers, projection screens, monitors or mobile devices. This service may be accomplished remotely via the internet or in person.</p>

<p><strong>Live captioning/Realtime captioning</strong>&nbsp;– A captionist (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62l64Acfidc">stenographer</a> or&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.ai-media.tv/blog/what-is-respeaking">respeaker</a>) &nbsp;captures the audio as it is being spoken and then using specific tools, relays this information to a display. This is accomplished either by remote captioning where the captionist receives the audio feed via modem or internet, or in the venue where the service is required. When this service is used during a live event to project the captions and video together, an additional piece of equipment called an encoder will be required. These terms are often used interchangeably with CART.</p>

<p><strong>Live-stream captioning/Webcast</strong>&nbsp;– The use of live captioning services that are integrated with a live event and made available online, at the same time as the event occurs, such as a webcast of an on-premise major event (i.e. Final Exercises), or online meetings, classes, or other events (i.e. Zoom, Adobe Connect, WebEx).</p>

<p><strong>Media player</strong>&nbsp;– A tool that combines the video file and the audio file to create the closed caption video product. It is important that the player is accessible and meets the requirements of WCAG 2/Level AA. This includes support for captions, audio description, keyboard-only controls, and other accessibility features.</p>

<p><strong>Post-production captioning</strong>&nbsp;– After the video is created or recorded, captions are created and paired with the video file.</p>

<p><strong>Subtitles</strong>&nbsp;– Translation of content into different languages. Subtitles assume the viewer cannot understand the language being spoken. In the UK and Europe, the terms “subtitles” and “captions” are used interchangeably.</p>

<p><strong>Transcripts</strong>&nbsp;– A verbatim text version of the audio presented. A transcript is not time synchronized with the video.</p>
