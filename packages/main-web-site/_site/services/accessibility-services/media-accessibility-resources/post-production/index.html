<p>Captions are text versions of audio content, synchronized with video, and include descriptions of all audio components necessary to understand the content and context of the video.</p>

<p>Essential to ensure understanding of video and audio content for the Deaf/Hard of Hearing community, captions also help non-native English speakers, make it possible to search video content, offer understanding of video in noisy environments, and offer the possibility to generate an interactive transcript.</p>

<p><strong>Post-production captioning occurs after the video has been recorded.</strong> (<a href="/services/accessibility-services/media-accessibility-resources/live">Live captioning is addressed in another section of this website.</a>)</p>

<p>There are generally <a href="/services/accessibility-services/media-accessibility-resources/methods">three methods</a> to create the necessary caption file to provide post-production captioning:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/services/accessibility-services/media-accessibility-resources/approved-captioning-and-transcription-vendors/">Outsourcing - hiring a vendor</a></li>
	<li><a href="/services/accessibility-services/media-accessibility-resources/do-it-yourself-captioning/">Do-It-Yourself (DIY)</a></li>
	<li><a href="/services/accessibility-services/media-accessibility-resources/methods#asr">Reliance on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Regardless of the method used, the generated end product is a caption file. Most files are plain text with time codes/time stamping to indicate start and stop times of the audio within the video. Once you have this file, the final step is to add this caption file to your video file. How this is done, and the supported file format of the caption file, depends on where your video is hosted.</p>

<p>Common hosting platforms in use at UVA include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>YouTube</li>
	<li>Vimeo</li>
	<li>Panopto</li>
	<li>Kaltura</li>
	<li>Zoom</li>
</ul>

<p>It is critical that the <a href="/services/accessibility-services/media-accessibility-resources/captioning-basics/#media-players">media player</a> used clearly indicates when captioning is available and has the ability to turn the captions on or off, adjust the size of the font, and change the contrast of the captions.</p>

<p>Before posting your media, you must assure accuracy of the caption content. Guidance and best practices for the display of captions can be found in the <a href="https://dcmp.org/learn/captioningkey">Described and Captioned Media Program: Captioning Key</a>.</p>

<p>Your steps to provide post-production captions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Create your caption file</li>
	<li>Check for 99%-100% accuracy</li>
	<li>Follow best practices for display and content</li>
	<li>Add to your video file on your hosting platform</li>
	<li>Make available on through your video hosting platform or media player</li>
</ul>

<p>The method you choose to create the caption file for your video depends upon the expertise and resources in your department/unit.</p>

<h3 id="when-to">When to Caption: General Guidelines</h3>

<p>Transcription and/or captioning is&nbsp;<em>required</em>&nbsp;for live and recorded events (including classes), when the event is made available to public, there is no registration process, or when an accommodation is being provided for an employee or student. Beyond these cases, there are many situations where captioning or transcripts are&nbsp;<em>beneficial</em>.</p>

<p>Automatic Speech Recognition technology is an option, but there are considerations to keep in mind and occasions where it may not be an appropriate solution.</p>
