<h2>About Video Description</h2>

<p><strong>Video description</strong> (also know as descriptive video or audio description) is&nbsp;provided for those who are blind or visually impaired. It&nbsp;offers additional audio about activities on screen that are essential to understanding the overall content. This added audio is inserted during pauses in the regular audio content.</p>

<p>In the classroom setting, it might be valuable to include video description in a video of a science experiment to ensure&nbsp;that a blind or visually impaired student can fully grasp the concepts being discussed.</p>
