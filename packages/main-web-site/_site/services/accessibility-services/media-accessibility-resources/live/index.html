<h3 id="when-to">When to Caption: General Guidelines</h3>

<p>Transcription and/or captioning is&nbsp;<em>required</em>&nbsp;for live and recorded events (including classes), when the event is made available to public, there is no registration process, or when an accommodation is being provided for an employee or student. Beyond these cases, there are many situations where captioning or transcripts are&nbsp;<em>beneficial</em>.</p>

<p>Automatic Speech Recognition technology is an option, but there are considerations to keep in mind and occasions where it may not be an appropriate solution.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/services/accessibility-services/when-to-caption">Read more about when to caption, how to identify whether your audience requires accommodation, and how to communicate this critical service &gt;</a></p>

<h2>Guidance</h2>

<p>Individuals who are Deaf and/or Hard of Hearing (D/HOH) may use a variety of options for communication access to an event. The best option will depend on the preference of the individual and the type of event.</p>

<p>Live captioning should be considered when hosting online meetings, webinars and other training events, and when streaming live events. It should also be strongly considered when hosting live events onsite. Adding live captions to the live event provides greater access and interaction for many members of the audience, not just those who are Deaf and/or Hard of Hearing.</p>
<img alt="Two people have a discussion on a stage, with a large screen showing text to their left" data-align="right" data-caption="Figure 1: Example of Onsite Live Captioning" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="391f6f99-b179-4936-9dc5-f6b835c71a2c" height="202" src="/sites/default/files/inline-images/captioning.png" width="302" />
<p>This service can also be used as a workplace accommodation for members of your department who are D/HOH. Live captioning of regular office meetings, departmental “Town Halls”, and other departmentally focused gatherings will allow for greater participation and interaction. More information regarding workplace accommodations can be found on the <a href="https://eocr.virginia.edu/ada-coordinator#ADA1">UVA ADA Coordinator’s website</a>.</p>

<p>The University’s general guidance is to employ live captioning by default when an event has an anticipated audience of 250 or more. It is important that you include a statement in event marketing materials that this service will be available. Even with captions in place, it is important that you also ask if other accommodations will be required by members of your audience.</p>

<p>A sample statement:</p>

<blockquote><em>The University of Virginia is committed to providing universal access to all of our events. Please contact [name, email, phone] to request disability accommodations. Advance notice is necessary to arrange for some accessibility needs. Please contact us at least seven days prior to the start of this event.</em></blockquote>

<p>If your anticipated audience size does not meet this threshold, a clearly visible statement in your event invitation, such as the one above asking if anyone participating will need accommodations, will help you determine if live captioning or other accommodations will be required.</p>

<p>Make sure to advertise in your marketing materials when captions or ASL will be available.</p>

<p>If a recording of the event will be posted online for access after the live occurrence, it is equally important that accurate <a href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/services/accessibility-services/media-accessibility-resources/approved-captioning-and-transcription-vendors/">captions are integrated with the post-production file</a>. You may be able to use the transcript from the live event as a starting point for the post-production piece. Make sure to ask for this transcript from the source of your live captions.</p>

<h2 id="integrating">Integrating Live Captions with Other Tools</h2>

<p>Many of the other tools used at the university offer integration with both post-production and live-captioning vendors. Some also offer automatic transcripts.</p>

<p>NOTE: Automatic transcriptions need to be checked for accuracy before posting a recording of the live event.</p>
