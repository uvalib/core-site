<h3 id="methods">There are three basic methods for creating captions for both post-production and live events:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Hire A Vendor</li>
	<li>Do-It-Yourself (DIY)</li>
	<li>Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="vendor">Hiring&nbsp;a Vendor</h2>

<p>UVA is able to utilize three competitively bid VASCUP contracts negotiated by George Mason University. These contracts are available to all higher education institutions, public school systems and executive branch agencies within the state.</p>

<p>Each vendor offers a variety of professional-quality services. <a href="/services/accessibility-services/media-accessibility-resources/approved-captioning-and-transcription-vendors/">Read more about hiring a vendor.&nbsp;</a></p>

<h2 id="diy">Do-It-Yourself Captions</h2>

<p>Captioning video is not technically difficult; however, it is very time consuming. You need to assess the value of your time or the time of your employees. When you consider the per hour rate, the cost of manually creating captions can be substantial.</p>

<p>Directions, software, and other tools are readily available online – some free, others rather expensive.</p>

<h2 id="asr">Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)</h2>

<p>While technology is advancing rapidly in this area, captions created by using ASR, such as those provided by Google for YouTube videos, are inadequate. At best, the ASR accuracy rate is somewhere in the 60%-80% range, whereas the ultimate accuracy goal of the post-production transcription/captioning process is 100% accuracy. Our minimum standard based on University Policy and requirements for standards compliance requires 99% accuracy. Although achieving this level of accuracy during live captioning is difficult, the closer to the goal the better. Keep in mind that <a href="https://www.3playmedia.com/2018/11/20/on-accuracy-part-i/">60%-80% accuracy means that 1 out 3 words in an ASR transcript are incorrect</a>. This inaccuracy can completely change the context of what is being said and provide inaccurate and misunderstood information.</p>

<p>In addition to inaccuracy of content, ASR provided through Google Slides and other presentation tools commonly omit capitalization, punctuation, and speaker identification. When selected, captioning in these tools is also always on, which may be confusing and distracting for some members of the audience.</p>

<p>Below is an example of ASR. What is actually said by UVA Head Men’s Basketball Coach Tony Bennett during the press conference after the Syracuse game; “... um, and kind of standing around and I didn’t like our zone attack...” The captions provided by auto-captioning – “...arm in China standing around in inanimate like Arizona taxpayers ..."</p>

<p>Although ASR is not a recommended captioning solution at this time, the resulting file can be a helpful starting point when creating your own captions or transcripts. As mentioned earlier, technology is advancing quickly in this area and you may find certain vendors produce a very accurate ASR file. You are welcome to explore, but remember the final transcript/caption file must be 99%-100% accurate and follow best practices.</p>
