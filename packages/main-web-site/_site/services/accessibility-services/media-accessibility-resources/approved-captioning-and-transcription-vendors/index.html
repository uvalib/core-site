<p>For <a href="/services/accessibility-services/media-accessibility-resources/post-production">post-production captioning and transcription</a>, UVA is taking advantage of three competitively bid VASCUP contracts negotiated by George Mason University. These contracts are available to all higher education institutions, public school systems and executive branch agencies within the state.</p>
<p>The concept behind this wide-spread availability is that the more minutes used of each vendor’s services — in aggregate across the state — the lower the price of these services for all! This allows for smaller entities to leverage the use of these services by larger institutions. Basic information can be found below — as contract administrators, <a href="https://ati.gmu.edu/mason-captions/">GMU provides more information about the contract and each vendor on their website</a>.</p>

<p>Although you may find vendors with a lower per minute charge for captioning than those on contract, the vendors selected met several criteria that in the long run will produce a better solution. These criteria included no additional charges for heavily accented speakers, speaker identification, etc. </p>
<p>When using these services, it is possible to integrate the captioning vendor with the hosting platform for seamless captioning, however, you are still responsible for assuring the accuracy of the captions. <br>
  Each of these vendors will provide guidance for integrating the caption file with your chosen hosting platform. </p>
<p>Three companies have been chosen to participate on this negotiated contract:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.3playmedia.com/virginia/">3Play Media</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://cielo24.com/partners/VASCUPP/">Cielo24</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://info.verbit.ai/Virginia">VerbIT</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Departments and units at UVA are responsible for the costs of captioning within their area. Instructions for establishing accounts along with information and pricing for each vendor’s services can be found below.</p>

<p>Each vendor offers more services than simple transcription and time stamping. Take some time to explore each company and choose the services that are most appropriate for your department/unit.</p>

<p>It is also important that you conduct a quality assurance review after you receive caption files back from any of our vendors. How much review and editing are required may also influence which vendor you choose to work with.</p>

<h2>Basic Pricing and Contact Information</h2>

<p>The pricing listed below is the current pricing for basic captioning services.  Each vendor  offers additional services and pricing options. Check each vendor’s page for more information on their complete set of products available through this contract.</p>

<h2>Setting up accounts</h2>

<p>To set up an account with any of the contracted vendors, contact the account executive directly. There will be a “parent” UVA account and your department/unit will be placed under that account.</p>

<p>Preferred payment for these services is by the University T&amp;E Card. Procurement guidelines prohibit from prepaying for services so your charges will be billed after your files have been converted. Each vendor has specific processes for payment — be sure to understand them before starting to use their services.</p>
<p>Should you have questions regarding post-production captioning, <a href="mailto:coaa@virginia.edu">contact the Coordinator of Academic Accessibility at coaa@virginia.edu</a>.</p>
