<p>NOTE: If you are considering live captioning/streaming for a student’s accommodation need, or if a request for American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation has been received, contact the <a href="https://www.studenthealth.virginia.edu/sdac">Student Disability Access Center</a> before proceeding.</p>

<h2>A quick start to incorporating a captioning vendor with UVA Zoom account</h2>

<ol>
	<li>If you haven’t done so already, <a href="https://virginia.service-now.com/its?id=itsweb_kb_article&amp;sys_id=51fa9ddddb059b084f32fb671d961989">establish a UVA Zoom account</a> and download the institutional version of the application to your device from the ITS Software Gateway.</li>
	<li>Although Zoom offers options of having the host or a participant provide captions, except in rare instances these are NOT considered best practices and discouraged. Establish a departmental account with a <a href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/services/accessibility-services/media-accessibility-resources/live#vendors">vendor who provides professional live captioning</a>.</li>
	<li>Make sure Captions are turned on for your application:
	<ol>
		<li>Manage your account by logging through the web-based Zoom portal (zoom.com)</li>
		<li>Go to “Settings” and assure that “Captioning” is turned on</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Open the Zoom application on your device.</li>
	<li>Select CC in the lower menu bar.</li>
	<li>Select “Copy the API token”. It will be copied to your clipboard.<br />
	<img alt="A screen shot of a dialog box to Assign someone to type, or use a 3rd party CC service through an API token. " data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="4500b82a-c2d1-48a5-87e9-86ebb010925f" height="153" src="/sites/default/files/inline-images/screenshot-captions.png" width="249" /></li>
	<li>Compose an email to your vendor’s contact and paste the token in the body of the message. It will be a long URL. Some vendors may have you paste the token in a web-based scheduling tool.</li>
	<li>When the captionist is ready, the CC indicator in the bottom menu bar will turn green.</li>
	<li>Each person can turn on/adjust the captions in their own application.</li>
	<li>Be sure to ask the transcript be saved and sent to you.</li>
	<li>If you are posting a recording of the meeting, you will need to provide accurate captions. Having this transcript will be very helpful. You may need to engage with a different vendor for post-production captioning.</li>
	<li>If you save the recording to the Cloud, you can also set <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115004794983-Automatically-Transcribe-Cloud-Recordings-">Zoom to provide an automatic transcript</a>. You will need to assure accuracy, speaker identification, and follow other best practices. This becomes an “interactive transcript”.</li>
	<li>See documentation on the <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/207279736-Getting-Started-with-Closed-Captioning">Zoom website</a> or contact your vendor for more information.</li>
