	<li>If you receive a request for an ASL interpreter from an audience member, contact the <a href="https://www.studenthealth.virginia.edu/sdac">Student Disability Access Center (SDAC)</a> to coordinate an interpreter for your Zoom session/webinar. SDAC may also contact you directly to let you know that someone in your session will be using an ASL interpreter as an accommodation.</li>
	<li>For a typical Zoom session/meeting, invite the interpreter just as you would any other participant. A person relying on ASL interpretation has the option to assure the interpreter is always visible. The viewer will “<a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362743-Pin-Video">pin the video</a>” so it is always visible to them. It does not affect a recording or what other viewers will see.

		<li><!--[endif]-->ZOOM WEBINAR NOTE: When using an interpreter for a <strong>webinar</strong> rather than a session, they will need to be <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005657826-Inviting-Panelists-to-a-Webinar">added as a panelist</a> and be visible for the entirety of the event.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>You may be asked to use an ASL interpreter in addition to providing live captions. That is a valid accommodation request. Follow additional guidance for providing the <a href="https://www.library.virginia.edu/services/accessibility-services/media-accessibility-resources/live">live captioning service</a>.</li>
