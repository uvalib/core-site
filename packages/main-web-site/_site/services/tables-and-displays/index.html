<p>Clemons Library encourages the use of library space by groups that wish to promote their organization. The following policies are designed to help facilitate the collaboration between organizations and the Library. Please be advised that these are our general policies. More specific policies and guidelines may apply and will be discussed when the reservation is scheduled.</p>

	<li>All permissions or approvals may be revoked at any time.</li>
	<li>The use of library space is permitted in designated areas only.</li>

	<li>No amplified sound is permitted.</li>
	<li>Food may be distributed, but cooking is not permitted, including on the Clemons Terrace.</li>
	<li>Organizations are welcome to place table-tents throughout the library space. Table-tents should be approved in advance and should also be removed by the organization when the event is over.</li>
</ul>

<h2>II. Responsibilities</h2>
