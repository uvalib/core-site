<p><span><span>Virgo, the Library’s online catalog, underwent a significant update in July 2020, from version 3 to version 4. The update was the culmination of years of work pulling together user research, internal expertise, and trends in institutional software and web development. </span></span></p>

<h2><span><span>Why now? </span></span></h2>

<p><span><span>The previous version of Virgo was built on now-outdated architecture and technology, and course reserves functionality was dependent on the even older “Virgo Classic”. Both of these versions — Virgo 3 and Virgo Classic — remained live until July 2020, despite neither being mobile-friendly for search and discovery. With improvements to search technology over the past few years, we knew we’d be able to deliver more effective and pleasant experiences through a fully rebuilt interface. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Though it wasn’t planned, and offered many additional challenges, the COVID-19 pandemic meant we also had a renewed urgency to better meet remote user needs through an updated interface.</span></span></p>

<h2><span><span>Where do we go from here? </span></span></h2>

<p><span><span>Most modern software&nbsp;is developed in a series of continual improvements, new features, and fixes. Rather than bringing out a massive new system every decade or so, this model allows us to modify Virgo&nbsp;often&nbsp;to make&nbsp;UI improvements,&nbsp;respond to&nbsp;user suggestions, and implement technical upgrades.</span></span></p>
